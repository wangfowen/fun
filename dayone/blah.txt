We migrated to Thrive, talked about life - life stories, what look for in people, what don't like about people, Mary told me the boots story about her friend, how her really good friend got mad at her and passive aggressively kicked her expensive boots. She was super mad about it and even now her friends sometimes bring it up as a joke \"why'd you kick my boots!?!? my boots!!!\"\n\nDrinks with Rox, Xuehai, Nicole. Talked about relationships, attraction, and how flirting plays a role. I think flirting is crucial when you're going for something short term since it's a straightforward way to signify that you're interested. Not as crucial for long term. I still don't quite know what the signals are to tell if there is mutual attraction / what exactly makes a relationship different from a friendship since I do feel physical attraction even towards friends. But it's more of an I acknowledge they are attractive thing.\n\n\n\n\n", 1358139600=>"Morning Due brunch with Rox and Xuehai - the potatoes were pretty great, the rest was okay\n\nBadminton with Rox, Kam, Frank, Wei, Jamie, and Wei's friend Jason.

Owen Wang! Zack has spoken about you before\". Sure hope that's a good thing.\n\nProceeded to go to laser tag from there. Groupon ended up being shady so we all played one game but it was pretty fun. Don't think I could've played that many more games anyways, so much running.\n\nWent to Pho Kim Long with the 24 of us. Then 4th St Bowl. Learned that its pretty hard to organize so many people to do anything. Crazy that so many places in San Jose were able to accommodate us last minute like that. Hilarious moment: Yanish has his arms around Jennelle from behind and Michael went up to them and pushed them apart.

Met up with Anna and we walked to some sandwich shop, then she took us to Christiania - the Green Light District. There was a hilarious guy who had a necklace with his baby's photo on it. He said he came to Copenhagen for a vacation, then decided to stay a bit longer, and when that extended vacation ended he reached the same conclusion and he kept extending it til now - he's lived there for several years now, has a wife and kid. Told us a funny story about how he made a water pipe out of a pond once. There were even fish in the pond.\n\nAnna went back to do work, so we walked through the city some more.\n\nLots of introspection the rest of the day on my thought processes. A lot of time I don't think about much, humming a song in my head, etc. Whereas Jamie is constantly introspecting as he walks. I like bigger groups of people for events, but at the same time I like to get to know people one-on-one better. I like planning events because I like to be included in things. I hate not being invited to things, even though there's usually a good reason for it. I yearn to be the center of attention. It may be due to my only child syndrome.\n\nWe grabbed langos from a food truck. It's a deep fried potato bread that's a specialty in Hungary. The owner was super nice and gave us suggestions for places to check out in the city.\n\nWe went back and I was super tired so I just lounged on my bed watching tv, then crashed the rest of the night, even though it was not even 8.

After we decided to go karaoke. I ended spending almost $200 that entire night. To end the night Xuehai was going to drive everyone home, but then one of the waitresses from Molly's stopped us in the parking lot and said she saw how much we drank and preferred if we walked home.

Jen mentioned how we should bring gopros to poker as a joke, but people were like omg this is a great idea. We'd be able to follow up on our hands, and we could make like a livestream if everyone gets one. Hilarity ensued in discussing variations involving taping phones to our heads, etc.\n\nHappy hour we were talking about spending money on trips to vegas vs trips to snowboarding, etc. Jen mentioned her friends were coming up from LA just for the food here, since the flight is just $100 and I was like omg... $100. Funny how we perceive the same cost differently. Later someone mentioned a $400 weekend in vegas, and same thing happened.\n\nAsh ran late by a couple hours since she was playing volleyball.

Decent view, pretty fun hike.\n\n\n\nThen we went to hike the mosaic staircase before sunset hit. The sunset district was of course completely foggy as usual so there was absolutely no sun to be seen. The fog was actually quite cool looking, and the stair was a solid climb. At the top of the stairs met up with Tommy, Maggie, and Jon. Also bumped into two other Waterloo people that I didn't know.\n\n\n\nWe ate dinner at iSkewers - fantastic dumplings and skewers. Tommy and Jon are so goofy and have the best conversations. \"What's your favorite dish?\" \"Ice cream\" \"Your favorite dick is ice cream?\" Then began an in depth conversation about what if dicks were ice cream and all the implications. Jon commented that I should take my life into my own control. He explained the conversation stack - an imagery for topics for conversation - but established my main problem is not conversation as it is the step before that. They again confirmed my theory that I should give up hitting on girls at clubs and just enjoy myself / dancing. Better to try harder at doing more things wherein I meet girls in better settings. Tommy is the same as me in that through forced interaction he is better at wooing girls. The reason I've done much worse since university is I've had much less forced interaction with girls.\n\n\n\nConversation stack: imagine a name card - first step = person's name. Imagine the name card on a table - next step = where do you work? what do you do? Imagine the table in a house = where are you from? Imagine a plane flying by the house = where have you been to? Travels? Imagine objects falling out of the plane = hobbies? Interests? Imagine the blinking lights on the tips of the wings = guiding light -> hopes, aspirations\n\n\n\nJon says those topics are boring for dates though. Have to try to be more interesting and energetic. Energetic I'm fine at, but what to talk about that's more interesting?\n\nGot ice cream at Ici in berkeley. It was so good that we bought two pints and extra cones. The cones were actually amazing. They tasted kind of like Asian egg wafers. Never had anything like them.\n\nChilled at Tommy's playing 7 wonders, shisha, beer, ice cream, and chips. I kept screwing up when distributing the cards. Like way too many times. I have no idea what was wrong with me there. Maybe mix of shisha and sleep deprivation? I don't know.\n\n\n\nAt 4am got up to watch the hockey olympic finals. Canada obviously won. I don't remember much of it since I drifted in and out of consciousness. Tommy tried explaining the rules but I don't really remember there.

We were one short for volleyball so Sean's dad joined in. He's super good, despite being apparently crippled in one leg. \n\nCame back in for lunch where we basically just ate whatever was around. Jon had miracle berries on him for some reason, so we did a mini picnic with that and drank lime juice and ate lemons. It wasn't as cool as I remembered it being.

Hilarious given how discrete we were trying to be.\n\nCalled my parents and walked around Westfield. Got some clothes from Ross, H&M, Gap, and American Eagle. Also got some apple headphones, which with our company discount I saved $3. Oh yeah.\n\nStopped by work to skype with Malcolm.

This guy learns languages by applying what he knows from music to languages - he first comprehends the rhythms and intonations, so he sounds like a native speaker, then tries to understand what he's speaking. He learned mandarin and portuguese that way and actually sounds native. Crazy.\n\n\n\n\n", 1371787200=>"Got offer from Twitter.

Very creamy and sweet, quite delicious. Read some Calvin and Hobbes while waiting for the train. Beats roommate had the entire collection.\n\nTook train to lucerne. Not much to see since it was super foggy. Checked out the old town, nothing too crazy. Decided to take full advantage of eurail pass and go to Milan since all of Switzerland seems foggy right now, with a pit stop in Zurich. The train station there were several marching bands playing. Appears to be some sort of festival. They were all dressed in medieval and crazy monster uniforms.\n\nZurich I walked around the park and along the water. Again, too foggy to really see anything in distance. It's a big city, lots of birds. Really all of Switzerland has a lot of birds. Got some pretzels and currywurst, which tasted about the same as in Germany. Very cool how switzerland has the two very distinct cultures\n\nTook train to Milan. On train met Eric. Pretty much embodies all bad stereotypes about America. Complained whole time on train, invited himself to my place in France, thought everyone was racist to him and wished he was a girl since they get free stuff, when needed stuff from others just talked at them without thanking or greeting and assumed they knew English, interrupted stories, only visited places for a day and just got pictures of the main tourist attractions, his only memory of some places was that he got stuff stolen since he was there so short. He thought North Korea is a good place since people don't have to worry about taxes or anything. Just about great leader. He's going to be a doctor to appease Asian parents. Makes me really appreciate my parents and being raised Canadian.\n\nI walked to a church nearby and it was pretty lame. Came back and crashed\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nLausanne trams are automated. There's no driver\n\nDon't take off shoes when hiking. Feet will swell with blood and get bigger. It will be painful after to put the shoes back on\n\nDrinking age is 16 in switzerland for beers, 18 for hard alcohol. Same with belgium\n\nSwitzerland has mandatory military service sometime before 25. Beat got assigned to some sort of radio signal listening job, where he'll be holed up in a bunker for 2 years. very unfortunate\n\nafter you finish high school, like france you can go to any university. the only exception is med school. that you need to apply for. and when you graduate from university you just get a letter with your grades on it. there's no diploma or ceremony.\n\nNunavut has 0.01 person per sq km. Switzerland is 40k sq km (earth is 40k something else), so there'd be 400 people in Switzerland by that ratio\n\nCow cheese is yellow tinted. Mozzarella should be buffalo cheese but they bleach cow cheese instead to get the white. Brie has fungus on the outside\n\nSwitzerland is part of schengen but not EU so don't need passport to enter but has different currency. England is part of EU yet also has different currency. How does that work?\n\n\n\n\n", 1379995200=>"Watched an episode of the latest season of Dexter, then wiki-ed the rest. Seems like it's okay.

Nick's the \"faux-founder\" of an education startup that's pretty secret til may. Joke by him: it's a platform - kinda like mario. *hand motions go up and down*\n\n\n\nMadeon - overall pretty disappointing. Shitty lights, nothing outstanding. I was basically surrounded by girls though, and they sprayed us with glitter and refreshing water vapor which was pretty cool.\n\n\n\nClay and I discussed the awkward social protocols of clubbing - how do you approach a girl and ask her to dance? where do you place your hands? etc etc\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nNaveen's ranked 11ish\n\n\n\nHacker news has a lot of hidden stuff for people who are actually in yc - office hour signups, bookface (yellow pages for other founders), posts by other ycs\n\nc# has lots of cool features like linq statements, dynamics, checked exceptions, delegates. \n\n\n\n\n", 1386651600=>"{tasks}\n\n- upload photos [na,1]\n\n- insanity [ex,1.5]\n\n- lunch [na,.5]\n\n- groceries [na,2]\n\n- plan trip [pl,1]\n\n- tip [cl,2] ~ haoyu, yalei\n\n- get skis [so,.5] ~ nathan, heather, viktor\n\n- dinner [so,2.5] ~ sam, frank, maria\n\n- waste time [na,.5]\n\n- study tip [cl,1.5]\n\n- skype parents [so,1] ~ parents\n\n\n\n{deets}\n\n- ski rental cheaper than expected\n\n- dinner at cafe at hotel de ville. we talked about how italians are very specific about when they drink certain coffees. swedish words - lahgun = just right. quite useful in most situations.\n\n\n\n\n", 1373947200=>"Ran errands all day, felt like I was in an mmo\n\n? -> Cindy's office -> printer -> cindy's office -> health services -> bank -> health services -> home to pick up call from fb\n\nDidn't end up getting the fb job, but i'm amazed at how they actually complied with my crazy deadlines and gave me great feedback.

Decent continental breakfast that had microwaveable burritos and stuff. We got a full day on the slopes. Last run we went into the closed off area since many other people had done it too. It turns out it was closed for a reason and not because they thought we'd have too much fun with it or something. The slope had no snow and we had to wade our way through some mud. Not pleasant. Max speed for the day was 41 kmph. Nothing fantastic, but better I guess. Looking at the footage after there's still something wrong with my technique, though I'm not quite sure what. I'm flailing my arms around a lot.\n\nThere was one black that was particularly fun since it was really steep and had just the right amount of powder, but it went from completely flat to steep slope and I'd always fall right at the beginning. Got much better at moguls from a couple runs that had them widely spread out. Definitely still can't do the normal moguls though.\n\nAfter we got back I skyped with ash for about two hours. I wanted to ask her about Linda's situation but instead it turned out to be much more with lots of hilarious stories and revealing stuffs. Her parents are apparently super chill and still go clubbing and have parties until 5am. They have a glass container of weed in the kitchen and none of her and her siblings knew about it until a friend visiting pointed it out. They didn't know what it was since they'd never seen weed before.\n\nWe also had some intense discussions about how there's two sides to every story, even things like gay marriage debates. I really like that we can talk about serious things but also have silly things mixed in\n\n\n\n\n", 1397361600=>"In the morning we met at Holders for breakfast. Along the way we made a pitstop at a gas station and Phil accidentally locked the keys to the bathroom in the bathroom\n\nWhen we got to Big Sur, the parking lot was full, which didn't bode well for the capacity at the Sykes Hot Springs, but we decided we could set up camp in the woods if that was the case. The hike turned out to be not as bad as I had expected. 10 miles with a backpack full of stuff strains the shoulders and lower back a bit, but was doable. We stopped for lunch and ate sandwiches. In our assembly line the previous night, Kris added the chipotle sauce to the sandwiches and just did random lines of it. So when we ate the sandwiches, we'd get random bites of spice - we called them chipotle landmines.\n\nAlong the hike someone saw a blue jay, and we got to discussing how the bluer a jay's feathers, the more likely they are to bang, then someone commented \"yeahhh\" with a sexual undertone, and the rest of the trip it became a running gag / comment used for everything.\n\nAlong the hike we met some pretty cool people. A group of girls doing a hike longer than ours that went to a different camp, a guy who's taking 6 months off to hike from Mexico to Canada - he's the head chef at a high end hotel, and an old couple who happened to mention that they knew someone at Apple when we mentioned we were interns in the area, and it turned out that person they knew was a higher-up of Zach/Pat.\n\nWhen we finally got to the hot springs, we found a small island along the rolling rapids and set up camp. We went to the hot springs but they were indeed full. While we waited, we picked random targets and all tried to throw rocks to hit them. Patrick was too good at it and always did it first. There were two legit hot springs, one higher up than the other, and we sat in the pool at the very bottom, where the hot springs water intermixed with the river water. It was a lukewarm pool and we called it the plebian springs. It represented our place in society, getting the trickle down effect from the higher ups. When the people at the ones above moved, we sprung at the opportunity to take over, moving up in our place in the world.\n\nWhen we got back to our camp, me and Zach got to setting up the tent. Patrick, Rachel, and Kris worked on getting a fire going. Tommy and Phil made dinner. Dinner was a delicious pasta with meatballs. Definitely a hot meal was a great idea. We didn't all bring bowls and forks so I used cardboard for a fork and Pat/Zach used cardboard for their plates.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nWhen you're crossing a stream you're supposed to unbuckle your backpack. Otherwise if you fall in, you may drown since you can't get back up from the weight on your back\n\n\n\n\n", 1395028800=>"Caltrained to Sunnyvale where I met up with Patrick. We headed to Santa Cruz with his roommate Zach, who's also from Connecticut. We were short on a water pack so we engineered one together with some tape and zip ties. They made jokes about the \"driving award\" they got from speeding earlier in the week.\n\nSanta Cruz we checked out the board walk. So many attractive women in bikinis. Grabbed some lunch at the beach. When the waitress checked out ID for drinks, she mentioned that we have the same birthday. What's a clever response to something like that?\n\nAfter lunch we hit up the mountain bike shop. They only had one of the cheap bikes left, so two of us had to get the lambo-equivalent of bikes. A bit more pricy but they were quite epic, with shocks that I didn't even understand, but seemed very fancy based on all the customization they had to do before we could use them. We arrived quite late so we only got a couple hours to do the bike trail. We went by the cliff and got a gorgeous view of the ocean, then went to the legit trail with the actual mountainous areas. Definitely not the same as a typical bike ride. A couple scary moments when the bike slips, etc, and going over the bumpy rocks is crazy. From all the ups and downs, the bike seat pretty much gave me a sense of what anal is like. Not pleasant.\n\nAt the cliff I spent so long trying to snapchat and take photos, I didn't get to really take in the view. And of course it never looks as good in the photos. Quite a shame. Letting technology get in the way of life. We tried to do some selfies while biking, which was hilarious.\n\nOn the way back we stopped by a southern bbq joint. The tri-tip or whatever it was called steak was amazing.\n\nThe way home had crazy traffic. We sang through the Frozen soundtrack\n\n\n\n\n", 1350878400=>"Day of studying for midterms. Lots of people coming in and out as usual - Rachel (brought us delicious banana bread!), Lily, Eric, Melvin, Carlie, Lindsey, Lux, Rox, Kent. Somewhat productive times, but of course also lots of dicking around.\n\n\n\nAt night again had hilarious / inappropriate conversations with Jason, Carlie, Stephane. This time about what happens if you break your penis. We looked it up and it doesn't appear you need to get a cast or anything, but imagining that was rofl.\n\n\n\n\n", 1396324800=>"Spent the morning being unproductive - creating new rdio playlists, talking to Xuehai and Jon, not doing work. Xuehai and Rox had broken up for a while now and he didn't understand how things could flip so suddenly. I feel like I understand Rox a lot better now even though I haven't seen her in so long. She's not a reliable friend, but she's a really fun one that I enjoy spending time with. So there's no point turning to her for help, but when she feels like showing up in my life again, I openly embrace it. When you're one of her top priority people, she'll do all sorts of things with you, but when you're not she flakes on you all the time or she'll half-heartedly hang out with you. She's not one to be tamed, but so be it. She has a lot to deal with internally.\n\nShopping after work with Tristan and Ethan. It seems I'm actually quite a picky shopper. Tristan found a shirt after like 5 minutes that he liked and bought it. I went to several places before I finally settled on something I liked. Tried several different colors of pants, but could not pull any of them off. Ended up getting some off-red pants from H&M and white pants from uniqlo. I need more shirts and shorts now also though. I need a personal stylist or someone to just shop for me. It's way too time consuming and I'm awful at it.\n\n\n\n\n", 1365998400=>"Woke up and quickly got my stuff together so that we could go hiking. The group had already split up to do different things, but we planned to meet at the Village Store. At the Village Store grabbed some delicious chicken fingers and breakfast burrito. Naveen's group was late so Vincent and I drove to Curry Village to check if they were still there. When we saw that they weren't, we headed back to the Village Store and there they were. I got really mad and blew up at them - partly due to frustration from group splitting up, annoyance that we may not finish the hike, grumpiness from not enough sleep.\n\nWe proceeded to the hike (Upper Yosemite Falls) and me, Nick, Tushar raced ahead on our own. Tushar and Nick really pushed the pace, I could barely keep up. Every time we stopped for a break / to get pics at scenic places, I could feel my heart racing like crazy. I downed 3 bottles of water and a bottle of gatorade before we got to the top. Tushar only drank one. I thought about quitting several times, but I guess peer pressure really works - got to the top in record pace. Though Patrick's group left ~40 min before us, they said they only got to the top ~5 min before we arrived. You got a pretty good view of the park and the waterfall from the top. There was a rope where people tightrope walked across, but we didn't see anyone doing it while we were up there (we saw some people do it when we were on our way down, but we were too far below to get good footage). We had a picnic consisting of Clif bars and PB&J sandwiches. So delicious post-crazy hike. There was a man carrying a baby on his back all the way up and he matched our pace. There was also an old man that beat us down the hill. We'd pass him, then take breaks, and he'd overcome us. Slow and steady really does win the race.\n\n\n\nAfter the hike we split our ways and headed home. We took a wrong turn and went on 140 instead of 120. We saw a bridge collapsed from rock slides - very devastating looking. Probably the cause of the flooded campsite. We also saw a pick up truck completely engulfed in flames somewhere near SF. A lot of astounding 'first's this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n", 1377403200=>"Had brunch in the morning with Brian, Andrew, Suraj, Jamie at Elmo's Diner. The food was meh, but definitely cheaper than Mel's or any other diner I've been to recently.Andrew drove me to Cameron Village where he works at the Rite Aid.

I can see him happy as an artist.\n\n\n\n\n", 1355893200=>"Rollerbladed / ran errands around campus\n\nRock climbing with Sean and Beat\n\nDoctor Who - tenth doctor is pretty good, but production quality is way lower, makes sense given the age\n\n\n\nTop Gear with Eric - American episode was pretty funny, but clearly very scripted.

Turned out Romain and Khallil were on the same flight, not that it really made a difference since we were all completely passed out the entire flight. The only time we woke up was to drink some free Mai Tais.\n\nArrived in Hawaii and went over to Khallil's house. The place is super sick - right on the beach side with access to a private beach (though there's no sand there, all rocks which is kinda scary). Weather's amazing and water is pretty nice.\n\n\n\nWe played around in the water a bit, went and grabbed some groceries, then chilled in the sun. The other group of people arrived so we went to get food. Ate at Cheeseburger in Paradise - had a Luau pig sandwich and pineapple smoothie. Hawaii is known for its pineapple. I'm going to eat as much pineapple as possible.\n\n\n\nMet up with Kam at our hotel then went back to Khallil's. We tried unsuccessfully to body board til Jason and Sarah arrived. We walked along the beach with them - saw some crabs, played some volleyball.\n\n\n\nWent back to the hotel to shower (pretty crazy night view from the balcony) then proceeded to dinner at Shore Bird. Quite an interesting dining experience. The fans on the ceiling were being pulled by a conveyor belt of sort that linked all the fans. Dinner was an all you can eat salad bar and steak that you had to grill yourself. Basically we paid obscene amounts of money to make our own food. The chef guy gave us seasoning then told us if we wanted our steak to be medium rare, put it on the grill for 4 and a half minutes on each side. We were too impatient and basically everyone had rare steak. Tasted pretty good. Music was people singing karaoke. So practically everything was do it yourself. There was one zealous karaoker who was dancing and going pretty wild. His wife was in the back clapping and hollering, and the rest of his crew was doing so also. \n\n\n\nRox requested a song but after we finished our meal she was still an hour behind in the queue so we left and walked around the town. Stopped for ice cream at Haagen Dazs, then proceeded home to sleep\n\n\n\n\n", 1398312000=>"Patrick Hannigan and Ian Gregory were in the bay for YC interviews. They came to Twitter for dinner and explained their startup - TicketLabs. They do ticket sales for small concerts, which right now are entirely driven by promoters. They're already profitable which is pretty cool. If I were to build a startup I'd want to do something that didn't need ads to profit as well. Patrick had the same mindset as me of not wanting to take funding, but he gave a good point for wanting take funding now - you'd be able to grow a lot faster and make exponential amounts of money in the same time. Even with the return on investments, it's worth it. The only downside I can think of is then your decisions are influenced by your investors.\n\nDid canadian taxes\n\nPoker night - hilarious hands where we went all-in with pretty much nothing, where we 6-bet with 2 chip raises. I was up about $100 for a good portion of the night, but the last hand I just threw it all away with an all-in that wasn't justified. Poker is also a game of stamina, but also this shows me that I can do dangerous things when I start disregarding the value of money.

Got in an intense debate about high frequency trading. Daniel was completely for it while Nick and I were very against it. It provides no value to the world and just makes rich people richer. But Daniel is very money-driven and that was completely okay for him, as long as he's in on the cut. I think I'd be happy working on a lot of different things, but I would not be able to work on something that was solely for money and didn't help someone somewhere in some way.\n\n\n\nHad an afternoon planned of blogging and editing footage, but instead got pinged by Dan Sotolongo about kitesurfing, so went with him for that. We drove down to San Mateo, where there's a cove that's perfect for kitesurfing. There were at least 20 other kites in the water there, never seen anything like it before. Apparently 20mph winds are perfect for kiting. Funny how you don't really notice something like the wind speed until it's important to you. Same goes with bike lanes, hills, etc. He showed me the basics with the air foil kite on land and I got to practice that a bit. It's all about pivoting your arms up and down, pulling the strings in and out, as opposed to actually moving arms forward and back. Kind of similar to wind surfing. When I got the hang of the pulling, I was to make bigger figure 8s where the wind would actually pull me, but do so without moving my feet. Instead I was to lean back and let the wind drag me. That was the point where I stopped. Next step would have been to watch the shadows while maneuvering the kite instead of watching the kite itself. Only after that would I have been able to go in the water. Dan did have the gopro strapped on though and the footage from that looked pretty cool.\n\n\n\nSince we were in San Mateo, grabbed dinner at Ramen Parlor. Ramen Dojo had too long of a line. Ramen Parlor was decent. Did not really like the crab but the soup and noodles were good. A kid at the table beside us exclaimed \"wow this is the best ramen I've ever had!\" His mom said \"this is only the second time you've had ramen...\" I like the way he looked at life. If it were me I'd have thought it was good, but thought that I didn't have a large enough sample size to determine how good it actually is.\n\n\n\nAfter I got home, spent the night going through and deleting bad old footage. Watching some of the bungee and cottage stuff gave me warm fuzzies. I went from 4GB left on my computer to 160GB free.\n\n\n\n\n", 1366776000=>"Lunch with Clay at Senor Sisig. Sisig wasn't as good as before for some reason - excessive tomatoes and the guac was kinda funky\n\nTwitter Party - talked to a good amount of people unlike at Khan Academy. Hopefully made a good enough impression that will be able to get an interview. Spoke with Nim for quite a long time about how machine learning is used in Twitter - anti-spam, figuring out trends (clustering), figuring out what friends should show to you to follow as first experience. Teams that'd be cool to join: Growth - Nim, analytics - Dmitry, mobile\n\nAlex Leong and Adrian pwned at DDR - reached a bonus stage and then high score screen. Didn't know about the existence of either of those before\n\nMet with Clay again at AppDynamics - played some Halo 4 online. I'm exceedingly terrible at it, fed like crazy. \n\n\n\nClay left to do more work. Played some ping pong with Jamie. Looks like my serve is still able to do magic. \n\n\n\n\n", 1378872000=>"Purchased tickets for Book of Mormon. Went to a couple places to compare prices. Realized after the fact the one we got ripped us off. We were too naive. They swayed us by saying how these were the only two tickets left and that they were beside each other (even though they weren't). We should have known that one of the tickets wasn't legit when there was a huge price gap between it and the other one listed on the ticket, but the guy said the seats circled around so even though the numbers were different, we were really close.\n\nWalked around Hyde park stumbled upon buckingham palace Big Ben and other landmarks\n\nTea - I got English Breakfast, Jamie got Earl Gray. It indeed tasted better with sugar and milk. Did a stop motion with the tea stuffs. A guy came in and asked to use the bathroom. The clerk said he had to be a customer and he threatened her saying \"I'm taller than you\". Very strange.\n\nGot food from some Japanese restaurant that had Wasabi in the name. Super cheap / huge quantity. Watched street performers while we ate. There was a beat boxer and a magician\n\nBook of Mormon - totally worth the money. Compared to high school plays, even though Enloe had good actors, the higher production value is very noticeable. They had real props and costumes and more appropriate cast / sliders on the floor to make scene changes seamless. There was tap dancing, rapping, soulful singing, and just generally good performing. The songs were all great and the plot was quite original / shocking. Great emotion inducing also.\n\nMet Mehdi and his coworkers at a pub, then went back to hang at Facebook. Mehdi and Jamie talked about Square/Facebook, I mostly ripsticked.\n\n\n\n\n", 1345262400=>"Started off the day with a couple interesting blurbs from book I'm reading - laughter isn't so much about funny things as it is about bonding. We're more likely to laugh in the presence of others, and that's why sense of humor is such an important quality in guys for girls - they feel like they bond better with the guys that make them laugh. Guys feel the same way about the girls they make laugh more.\n\n\n\nWe're able to communicate with languages because of the fact that we stand upright. It gives us better breathing control which other animals cannot do, and since we can vary our breathing, we're able to vocalize in a meaningful manner, whereas animals have to breathe with each vocalization they make so they cannot form any meaningful strings.\n\n\n\nHow we communicate has drastically evolved with our technology. Back in the days of silent films, body language was how communication was truly expressed. With radio it was more spoken words. With newspaper it was more written, and now we're at a stage that combines body language and words. This is especially important for politicians. \n\n\n\nHad a great day of pairing with Salman. It's always a blast with him. I think we'd have been great friends if we were at Loo at the same time. We get lots of good work in and have lots of laughs at the same time. Ended the work day with some ping pong and talking about gaming. Waterloo used to have an arcade apparently, and he was super good at foose ball, guilty gear, smash bros. Got wooped by a couple of girls who you wouldn't think were good... can't tell the story the same. That man is a great story teller. I have a lot to learn.\n\n\n\nWent out to the intern dinner but no one showed up except for Justin, Terrence, and someone new: Jonathan Chen. Jonathan's a pretty cool guy, hopefully I'll hang out with him again in the future. Justin and Terrence... as I initially judged Justin doesn't seem all that bright and yet thinks he's all that. He and Terrence had the most pretentious conversation I've ever bared witness to. They talked about fancy cars, watches, tailored clothes, yachts, etc etc. I don't even understand. If you've got a butt load of money, why not do something good with that time and money. Are you really going to spend it talking about your butt load of money? Jesus. And the way they talked about money. I was pretty disgusted\n\n\n\n\n", 1364961600=>"After work grabbed Blue Bottle Coffee with Greylock Julie.

We built a recipe box app. First time dealing with Windows 8, or any sort of legit C# programming. WPF is kinda like writing html except I had no idea what the different elements were or how they interacted with each other. Took a while to pick up on and even now I still don't get it all. Whenever I deployed my visual studios crashed so I couldn't really experiment with things or debug, and my xaml viewer also wasn't working so I had no idea if I was doing anything right. Michael and Jack hard-carried the hackathon. We ended up getting third, which wouldn't have been so bad if the hackathon weren't so dumb. Second place was a unit conversion app which didn't look that well designed, and for sure was super simple to make. No idea what they judged the hackathon on. As third place we won one computer mouse split amongst the three of us. First and second place got a phone that was split amongst them. Ridiculous that they didn't even have a prize for each winner. Aside from that, there was very little / very crappy food - pizza that ran out super fast the first night, then two meals of Timmy's the next day. The hackathon was in a lecture hall so you couldn't easily maneuver over and see what other people were working on. Their shirts were the ugliest things I've ever seen and they were only available in small and medium and they wasted so much time with giving them out by announcing names of participants / taking pictures of them for each shirt giving.\n\n\n\nAt night made martinis with real coconut. Did not realize coconuts were so hard, we had to hammer a chopstick with a mug to pierce it. Then the others went off to Semi and I watched Beastly with Carlie and Vicky. Not a very good movie.

Every 10 min a clue given on which direction the ship traveled. Couple of small clever puzzles - from words that you got from the puzzles, you spell out \"Day Ship Sank\", which is another clue. Given a blacklight after completing 3 things, then given a chest after completing rest. Chest contained batteries for the blacklight, but was locked. Lock combination was 02/29, which is day the ship sank (figure it out from 50th aniversary, yet 200th year sailing).

The lines to try to get tickets are insane. We actually waited an hour. We then booked a different hostel in Rome, and grabbed lunch at a Trattoria Pizzeria (Trattoria means traditional, which apparently means they're pretty legit). I had prosciutto pizza. Quite delicious, but doesn't seem like the best pizza I've ever had. Most restaurants advertise at the front that they have A/C so I guess that's a huge selling point there.\n\n\n\nWe got Roma Passes - we heard that lets you bypass the massive lines at the Colosseum and gives you awesome other perks like free access to the metro.\n\nWalked to the Colosseum and toured it. Definitely another amazing creation that I can't even begin to understand how it got built, but doesn't seem as amazing as pretty cathedrals, etc. We got some hilarious shots for our statue mimicking photo series. I think we went too far. We ended on one that requires a sheep.\n\n\n\nMetroed back to the hostel. This time it was a room for 8. Larger group isn't always better. You still share one bathroom so it can get inconvenient. And this time we had a large group of New Zealanders. They were pretty tight-knit and so we didn't hang out together and had minimal small talk.\n\n\n\nWe were going to hit up the Vatican in the afternoon, but we were too tired so just ended up passing out instead. Woke up and did some planning for the upcoming days and suddenly it was 10pm. Grabbed dinner at another Trattoria shop nearby - got some sort of pasta I never had before called Trofie.

Jumbalaya was at the recommendation of the waitress too, usually they never give legit recommendations. Kam passed out after one half yard and went home.

Bumped into Andrew (rox's lab partner), guy from Xtreme Labs, and one of their friends. Symphony was okay, they pretty much butchered Concerto in D Minor - never thought about how hard of a piece it actually is before / in general having to play in sync with so many other people for so long. Just one person's screwup would mess it up for everyone. Also composers are super pro - piecing together such beautiful music for so many different instruments combined. The Symphony in D Minor was much better, albeit extremely long. \n\nBumped into some people working at facebook outside of the symphony.\n\nBoba Guys - they ran out of tapioca so got a regular with almond jelly. Still pretty good. Would go back again to try the one with tapioca\n\n\n\nTokyo Expres for dinner with Kam. Very meh.\n\n\n\nIdea:\n\nUse CV to figure out what's going on in a football game. Automate commentary, etc as done in NFL games. Get better analytics also\n\n\n\n\n", 1346385600=>"Had my final evaluation talk with Salman. He is a great man and I highly look up to him. He dresses well, lives healthily, has great communication skills, and is in general lots of fun to be around. Our evaluation was very thorough and I feel like I learned a lot about myself through the process. He says one of my biggest weaknesses is communication and I highly agree. I'm very bad at communicating technically and I don't have pride in my work, so when people disagree with my code, I don't stand up for my code. But he says I should not speak technically all the time, I need to learn to use it when appropriate. For example, when I'm talking to a sales person, they don't care about if the API calls are blocking. They just want to get more credit cards so I need to explain to them why something would prevent them from doing so. To be a good salesperson you must communicate in a way that the person makes the realization for themselves. Also, ask lots of questions to understand other people's views, don't just jump to assumptions. And don't assume that people understand everything you did. Explain everything you've tried or others will think you haven't tried anything. \n\n\n\nBeing interested in something gets you a long way. You're more tedious with your work when you care about it and you better understand how things really work. \n\n\n\nAt night we went to a comedy club - Filmdrunk. The comedians basically all made dick and masterbation jokes. \"How come when you die in a fire, your loved ones still have to pay full price for the cremation? Half the job's already been done!\" A couple of funnies, but most were pretty meh. Hit up In n Out nearby and proceeded home. \n\n\n\n\n", 1395979200=>"At lunch Dan and them were discussing the gym stipend, and we got to discussing what if we made up our own gym just to collect the $100 a month. We decided gym fraud would be the stupidest thing to get fired for. Afterwards we decided letting strangers in for lunch for money would be a even stupider thing to get fired for.\n\nWe got served escargot for lunch and Dan said he refused to eat anything with eyes on it. Even if he doesn't eat the actual eyes, it feels too real as opposed to just a piece of meat.\n\n\n\nAfternoon was the intern offsite. Went bowling at yerba buena. First round I slowly got back into the groove of spinning and ended with 94. Second round I got much more consistent with not dropping the ball and doing the spin correctly, but it spun so much it always ended in the other side's gutter. I tried adjusting my angle, etc, but nothing seemed to work. Ended the round with 21. Next round I accidentally figured out that it was because I wasn't throwing it with enough confidence / hard enough. When I put more force behind it and it spun faster, it wouldn't curve until later and worked out much better. We didn't finish that round, but I alternated between gutter balls and 9s / strikes.\n\nJokes about how ingress is kinda boring since no action really ever happens. It'd be more interesting if people did actual raids. Like both factions swarm to a place and knock phones out of people's hands to claim the place.\n\n\n\nChilled at work and did taxes, played some guitar, watched suits. The piano finally got fixed and Dan was playing for the entire time I was at work. Roughly 3 hours. Crazy. He really should be in music instead.\n\n\n\n\n", 1396238400=>"Terrible night of sleep. Freezing in the tent. Should have brought change of hoodie. And warmer socks. In the morning the trees were steaming. Never seen that before. Beer and beef jerky for breakfast. Cleaned up camp and headed to Santa Cruz. Stopped by Mission BBQ for lunch. As good as last time. Their tri tip steak is just amazing. Perfectly succulent and very well sauced.\n\nIt turned out to be too wet to rent the nice bikes and the shop didn't have enough of the crappier ones, so we went to the beach instead. We tried climbing the rocks to get closer to the waves. We started with the smaller rocks, then slowly escalated to the taller ones. At this point the tide rose and it actually got quite scary. At one point Zach didn't make it to the next ledge in time and got swept up by the waves. We watched as he tried to grab onto anything he could and we had no way to help him. I was paralyzed in shock, while Patrick slowly edged towards him to maybe help somehow. I really am awful in critical situations. The look of fear on Zach's face was absolutely insane. \":O\" really is the closest description I can give for that. Thankfully the tide eased up and he managed to grab something and get back up. If not, Zach may have actually died. This definitely was one of our stupider ideas. The first thing Patrick said after Zach was okay was \"was the gopro on?\" That's how you know you have the right friends. With enough life and death situations for one day, we chilled on the sand for a bit and then walked back to the car. There appeared to be an abandoned rail road so we walked on that.\n\nTo end the day on a calmer note, we hit up another hike nearby. Castle Rock in saratoga. The hike turned out to be even milder than Big Basin with a even smaller waterfall, but there were some decent climbing rocks.\n\nWhen I got home I took a hot shower and called it a day, despite it being only 9:30. Was feeling a bit of chills and fever and definitely didn't want to get pneumonia or anything.\n\n\n\n\n", 1361509200=>"Worked on butternife again with Naveen. Got it back to functional state after meteor update. Twas just a security update they made.Went to Kartik's and watched Happy Gilmore. His penthouse suite is pretty legit. You need to press the elevator buttons in a certain order to get up\n\n\n\n\n", 1402200000=>"Donnie made pancakes for breakfast. Spent the hours of daylight playing frisbee and volleyball. The previous night waterloo won at boat racing. We got destroyed at frisbee. Carlton was super pro. Volleyball we won for the most part. Connie was really good, but so was Jamie. We generally all got better over the course of the weekend.\n\nRox's eye got more and more swollen over the weekend and she tried all sorts of ointments and stuff at the recommendation of different people. We began another running gag of referring to lucie as \"cleric\".\n\nThere was one point where connie rubbed ointment on roxanne's eye as they danced to music. Hilarious.\n\nJon and Connie made really delicious Ravioli for lunch. Connie's a super chef. She helped a ton with every other meal also. When Jon and Connie went to prepare lunch, we also began preparing dinner.\n\nSean and I made pulled pork, vegetarian chilli, and grilled corn for dinner. People were super impressed with the pulled pork. Felt good. Got a campfire going and made s'mores. Bonnie and Connie both had never had them before. We tried to get everyone to tell an epic story, but given we had so many people, there ended up being a bunch of side conversations that got going. Hard to maintain the attention of everyone. Donnie retold the story about him being stabbed by his ex. Hilarious as always. Michael told the story about a time he got high and tried to make coffee. He had never made coffee before and read the instructions off of the can. The can said \"instructions for coffee maker\". He thought \"I'm the coffee maker! These are instructions for me\". \"1. pour water into cup\". So he poured himself a cup of water. \"2. add coffee\" so he poured the coffee into the cup. He figured that still wasn't coffee so he microwaved it. Needless to say, it was awful.\n\nAfter campfire we chilled inside and sang the Dr. Horrible soundtrack until 4am-ish\n\n\n\n\n", 1364443200=>"Supposed to meet with Albert for tennis but forgot key at work so had to go back to office.

Met with our consultant for FYDP\n\nRock climbed with Sean and co. Got pretty beat up but did a really fun top rope and looks like I can do the easy boulders now.\n\nSean and them went to bomber but I decided to skip to keener and study BIOL and other classes. Funny how that appeals more to me than getting drunk now\n\n\n\n\n", 1346990400=>"A much better day of froshing given the weather. Junkyard Wars I led the Keep Edcom Cool event where we built a handcrank fan, moveable wall, and a crown for making Edcom metaphorically cooler. We did not do that great in the event, but overall everything seemed to go smoothly and Frosh enjoyed themselves.\n\n\n\nThe other events Aerial Photo, Meet the Tool, and Eng101 went fine. Passage through the Polyverse was a new event and it was pretty outstanding. In this event we went through different stations to learn a bit about campus services and our \"champion\" collected ridiculous articles of clothing to aid in his battle. Some of the stations were a bit lame but a couple were fantastic: the one about the libraries involved our champion studying for a math test while distractions like Facebook and Reddit occurred i.e. he tried to solve a math problem while Frosh tossed wet sponges at him. After all of the stations, the champions battled it out on balancing beams, symbolizing the balancing act of First Year and how the different services provided on campus aid in that battle.\n\n\n\nFollowing we tried Grab a Greek. I'd give it 4 stars, it's pretty decent. Then we went to Monte Carlo, where we felt super old. It's strange that the Frosh are just two years younger than us yet they look way younger. A lot of the music I didn't recognize and that made me sad. I've lost touch it seems. After Monte Carlo we hit up Pop and Chips.\n\n\n\n\n", 1376884800=>"More shopping with parents. Bumped into Lee when we were at Costco. The baked chicken at Costco is actually really good, and also super cheap. $3 for a sub-sized crunchy pastry with chicken, bacon, alfredo inside.\n\nMet up with Mark. Made an instagram account and broke first blood with a pic of some cookout that I got. Watched Kick Ass 2. I didn't particularly like the movie. Felt a bit too vulgar / the fighting too realistic. Not really the feel-good kind of crazy choreographed fighting.\n\n\n\nWent to flying saucer where we met up with Kirsten, Bao, Kishore. This place has 80 beers on tap, over 300 kinds of different beers in total. Local pints are $3. They have a program kinda like MBA except you become a beerknurd after drinking 200 different types of beers and you get a gold plate with your name on it placed on their walls.\n\n\n\nWe talked about a game Mark played where you make a sound and people try to guess what movie it's from. Also played \"who do you think is the most famous person from X\" where X could be a type of sport or something else. Bao's working at BCG and Kishore's working at IBM. Apparently Eric Regensburger's farm now owns 2 water buffalos and also a pig that can read. They'd show the pig signs like \"left\", \"right\", \"jump\" and the pig would listen. Also did not know that pigs could jump.\n\n\n\nKirsten drove me home. She did an unpaid internship at a clothing startup and she had to work for a couple days at the sweat shop the company owned. She wants to be a buyer after graduating. That's the person that makes the decisions for what to stock the stores with.\n\n\n\n\n", 1394596800=>"First time doing Tweet Feet. I ran with a guy named Justin, though he didn't seem that interested in talking. I ended up doing about 4 miles at a 10min/mi pace. Farthest I've run in a while.\n\n\n\nMet up with Tyler Machado. I thought it'd be really awkward but he was actually super chill and interesting to talk to. Definitely in terms of where we are in life, we're in very different situations, but it wasn't a big deal. He's doing cool stuff in enviro related to ethanol and we talked about Europe as he had recently been as well. His experience is much more like the one expected, with lots of couchsurfing and whatnot.\n\n\n\nI headed back to work afterwards to finish up some stuff for TED. Dan and Victor were still at the office playing online poker. They were playing two games at once and had a heads up display on top of the game so they could see each player's vpip and other stats. Really cool stuff. I wonder how profitable a Poker AI would be that makes bets based on those stats. It was also cool that they talked out all the moves they made. It was like paired programming but with poker.\n\n\n\n\n", 1394254800=>"Was going to do a big dinner thing but everyone at Twitter ended up bailing. This, coupled with Judy bailing and the couple other times recently I got bailed on felt kinda shitty. I'm much better now at not expecting people to have time for me, but getting bailed on still feels crappy.\n\n\n\nWent to food trucks area with Ryan and them and then rented our equipment. Slept early since we had to get up early for snowboarding the next day\n\n\n\n\n", 1400385600=>"Woke up early to clean my room and wrap the gift and stuff. Decided that for lunch I'd cook for Rui, so last minute scrambled to buy ingredients and clean the kitchen also. Met up with Rui at DC and she surprised me with some ice cream and a lottery ticket. We talked about what we'd do if we won as we walked through waterloo park. Sat in the park and ate the ice cream, checked out the petting zoo, then went to valu mart to get groceries. Talked about all the hard things in raising kids, what makes people happy. We decided to make burrito bowls so got ingredients for that, then headed back to my place. \n\nWe stood out in the balcony looking out and talked about souls, the future of humanity, sadness of death. I showed her how to make Estonian cookie cake, then made burrito bowls. The burrito bowls were alright, but she was thoroughly impressed with the cookie cake. The whole time we were at our place Jason was stalking us. He put clothes over his head and laid down on the floor of his room to eavesdrop. \n\nAfter food we sat in my room and I showed her my bag of mementos from Europe. In the midst of that she noticed it was 5 and she had to rush to get to work.\n\nI played some smash bros with Jason until Xuehai and Nicole came. They played a bit too, but were absolutely awful. Then we headed up for hot pot. We were going to do it all ghetto, standing around the stove, but Xuehai insisted we do it legit and he went out and bought a portable gas stove. Hot pot turned out really well.\n\nAndrew, Carlie, Calvin came over after we finished eating and we headed to karaoke. Beat^2 box is absolutely awful in terms of equipment. You can't search for song names and searching for artists is confusing since it's a T9 that doesn't work as expected. Apparently you're supposed to search by the first letter of each word, then press OK. Also a lot of the stuff in the database was wrong - Toylor Swift, a lot of stuff listed under Hip Hop as the artist, etc. Still fun though. We were all awful at singing. Rui joined us halfway through after she had finished work.\n\nAfter karaoke the others wanted to get food. Me and Rui ditched to get Cheeses Murphy, which turned out to be closed. Instead we chilled atop the parking garage and she ate a clif bar she had on her / some cider. We sat there listening to my small collection of chinese music, her in my arms. It felt really homey. \n\n\n\nAfter a while we bussed to her friend's place where she was staying. There was a super high guy at the king/university stop and he was crying and there were cops. No idea what was happening. \n\n\n\n\n", 1376193600=>"IHOP in the morning. We took a wrong turn and ended up by the peak of the falls. The sun was directly above it, the fog covering the sun. It looked pretty amazing. At IHOP the girls were at one table, the guys at the other. Pretty much all the guys were passed out. Tried discussing Jon's love life through a metaphor about Jay-Z and Kanye, but it didn't reveal much - post \"San Francisco Tour\", Kanye didn't make any new mixtapes, he's still working on his solo album. We did another UW vs UofT competition - dips. Me and Freddy each did 15. Jon did 10, Xuehai did 9. So UofT won that one. \n\nDrove back - conversed with Rox to keep her awake - talked about if we have had any regrets in our life, our high school friends.\n\nAttempted to study for a bit with Stephane\n\nSkyped with Ashton for 2 hours, talking about our impressions of each other, life philosophies on happiness, how confidence is just about relaxing and not overthinking. When you overthink, just do something silly to stop. If you don't have the other person to talk things over with, all the negative thoughts just build up, which isn't good. Apparently Jon earlier in the day did a food challenge successfully, but then threw it all up shortly after.\n\n\n\nWatched the Truman Show. Way better movie than I expected. Pretty deep stuff about how we accept the world we're given, and how we have to break through walls if we really want something badly.\n\n\n\n\n", 1379390400=>"First day of class. Super easy since in English. Met Nathan Wilson (Australian) and Nick (American). Got lunch with them and their friends, then did groceries / other chores with them\n\nMet roommate finally. Jean-Francois - Canadian! He's from Montreal so he's actually fluent. He took me to a hang out with some of the people he's met. They were French and I couldn't keep up with their conversation of course. Conversed for a bit with a Chinese-French girl named Cici. It is quite hard to be funny/interesting when you barely speak the language\n\n\n\n\n", 1374984000=>"Woke up early to make breakfast. Made scrambled eggs while Ash made salad. Jon spiked the scrambled eggs with Black Label, and it actually turned out pretty goodStarted out day with some volleyball. Me and the ladies played the other guys and we won. Ash and Rox are a very good team. Sean is also decent. Jon's surprisingly terrible considering he's good at basically everything else. We played UW vs UofT and it wasn't even fair, we completely dominated. \n\nSwam to the island / did some jet skiing\n\nWent back in to eat lunch\n\nWent sailing with Joel and Sean. I didn't harness in properly and fell into the water. Wasn't as bad as Xuehai and them following - they went in during a storm and the water was crazy. They flipped at one point, basically traumatizing Rox forever. Sailing's a lot of fun. Definitely will want to learn how to do it properly\n\nJammed out some more. Cups-ed more. We got it to a point of throwing the cup to people across from us. \n\nCampfire - made smores, played 2 truths and a lie. Donnie's story will go down in history. He was once stabbed by an ex with a fork because he wanted to help her make food and she didn't want him to. They looked at each other, and looked down at his hand with the holes in it, and that was it. Should've been a sign she was crazy but he still didn't break up with her, and even after she cheated he still didn't.\n\n\n\nOne of Sean's neighbors gets epic fireworks from the states and was shooting them\n\n\n\nJon was super high and was freaking out over the fire. He required that Xuehai sit to one side and Donnie to the other to calm him down.\n\n\n\nPlayed some more beer pong. Not sure if it was because I drank sangria or what, but I did extremely well for the first time ever.\n\nSome people went to bed, the rest of us played Kings Cup. Ash and Sean got mated early on and Ash actually held her ground tanking the amount Sean was drinking\n\nStayed up til almost 5 talking with Sean and Ash about life. In a game of Fuck, Marry, Kill between the three of us that were sailing, apparently the girls unanimously decided it'd be Sean Me Joel. Not sure if good or bad thing. Ash is pretty awesome. She's very well grounded - doesn't expect boyfriends to be there for every little problem, made her own life decisions about who she dated and whatnot, works really hard, is basically an awesome person.

I left a bit early to grab dinner with Clay and Tiffany at SO. I made plans for a second dinner at House of Prime Ribs so I didn't plan on eating much, but SO was delicious as usual and I ended up eating quite a bit. I went back to work afterwards to try and submit my code into review queue, but apparently I required a ship it from Dev Prod. I sent them an email saying how I urgently needed that ship it. I tried running some more tests, but apparently I had gotten my ssh access revoked.\n\nWent to the second dinner with Brian, Justin, Dan, Ben, and Aaron whom I just met. House of Prime Ribs was pretty good, but I think I like steak more than prime ribs. They had some fancy salad spinning thing and the salad tasted amazing.\n\nWent back to work and got the ship it. Finally merged my project into master at 2am. At one point I wanted to go upstairs to shower and I got trapped in the elevator since they revoked my badge access.

I had a couple of tweets written up but when I tried to post them, Jennifer kept demanding things be changed - reword things so non-technical audiences will understand, we can't talk about our core values, she left out a funny comic I had for one of them, etc.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon I volunteered at the Tenderloin Tech Lab with Vikas, an engineer on the Ads Billing team. It was definitely one of the most eye opening experiences I've had. The first lady I helped was an old lady who wasn't getting the health care money she was supposed to. She needed to find a lawyer to help make it happen. The whole thing was heart wrenching.\n\n\n\nIt made me realize how important lawyers are to the world. From tech law suits I just saw them as a way for bigger companies to bully smaller ones, and from Suits I just saw it as a way of bending the truth to get whatever you wanted, but there is a side of it where they're helping people who are being bullied to fight back. \n\n\n\nThis lady wasn't sure how to google to find lawyers, so I showed her how you can search for different key words related to what you need. She would then copy down that information on paper, and I showed her how you can use google drive to save it instead. She was confused by the difference between the different drives - \"shared with me\", \"starred\", etc, and she didn't know you could copy-paste instead of typing it all back up again. It made me realize how important design really is. Not the overdesigning crap that people are doing these days to be creative with gestures / make things really pretty, but the simple cues that allow people to understand how to use a product. It really sucks that with AJAX, etc, it's great for people like me who have taken all these cues for granted and just want fast load times and what not. When the page doesn't load and things just happen, it's really confusing for people like her. And it must really suck that apps now all have their own interfaces instead of being standardized to one like through Microsoft. People like me enjoy the fresh interfaces, but now you don't know where to click to close things, etc.\n\n\n\nIf working at the government taught me anything, it was the importance of the little things, like making images accessible for the disabled.\n\n\n\nThe second lady I helped was a french lady who wanted to practice mail merge on microsoft word. I didn't even know about that feature, but it wasn't hard for me to pick it up. She was really nice and when she had to enter an example recipient for the mail, she used the name Monsieur Owen Dupont. So precious. She corrected my pronunciation of Monsieur. It sounds like muh, not mon.\n\n\n\nLastly I helped a lady who didn't understand the new yahoo mail. She kept saying how she's really smart, but even she couldn't figure out the piece of crap redesign and how she wants to hurt the people who did it. She was annoying to work with and really tested my patience. I guess I can't be only working with adorable elderly people. Have to see the other side of the tenderloin. People like this lady make me realize that I'm not really cut out to be dealing with people. I'm not good at hiding my emotions when dealing with people I don't like.\n\n\n\nWhen I went back to the office I had my 1 on 1 with Franklin. He didn't have any negative feedback for me, said I picked up the stack and Scala pretty quickly, etc. I mentioned that Waterloo has 5 tiers in its grading system, where would I rank? He said probably in the top half. Super vague. I asked how I could go up in ranking, he said he wasn't sure. Definitely makes me realize the importance of good mentorship at a company. Franklin is a great mentor in the fact that he's really nice, patient, and knowledgeable, but is not good in that he can't seem to give criticism.\n\n\n\nWe didn't have happy hour today due to the Global Tea Time, so we decided to have our own Observability Happy Hour - Franklin, Justin, Megan, and I. We drank some beers and just chilled and talked. Megan explained that \"break a leg\" originated from \"break aleg\". Aleg is the rope that holds the curtains up or something in a theater and break aleg means the applause is so loud that the curtain falls down from the sound. Apparently you should never wish a theater friend good luck. That's considered bad luck. You have to say break a leg or merde.\n\n\n\nTristian, Kyle and I went over to Dropbox for dinner. They had oysters with people shucking them, and pesto prosciutto pizza, and other fancy things like that. By the end of the night there were about 10 of us Waterloo kids from the area visiting Jackie. We played board games in a meeting room. Started with some 7 wonders - it seems the general best strategy I've found is to invest in a bit of everything. Then we switched over to blokus and played a drinking version of it, where each time we were blocked from making a move, we had to chug half a bottle. Me and Tristan got demolished and had to down several bottles of beer. By the end we legitimately cleaned out Dropbox's fridge. It was a bit awful. We were being quite obnoxious.\n\n\n\n\n", 1406865600=>"For lunch I grabbed food with SPCOM people at Molly's - Andrew, Suman, Austin, Kevin, Tharindu. Pretty fun group to hang out with.\n\nWorked on the LED ring with Stephane and Kyle. Nicole worked on MATLAB in the room as well. Felt like I was finally putting my degree to use. Learned a lot of basic hands on things I don't understand how we never learned in class, like soldering and crimping. Also voltmeters and oscilloscopes finally felt useful. The design lab in E5 is pretty great. I wish our labs were like that. The feeling from blasting music while soldering together with friends felt really nice. Why weren't my lab experiences like that? Feels like we have too much busy work in school that we never really think about what the tools are useful for. Soldering was really fun for the super tiny things, felt like I was performing surgery. We needed a microscope to check out the soldering and everything. There was a bug with the multiplexor that took a couple hours to figure out. The one Stephane bought didn't match exactly the one he previously used, and after much debugging figured out it was due to there being an internal pull-up resistor. The concept of pull-down and pull-up resistors made sense from this. Debugging hardware does not seem fun though. So much harder than software.\n\nAfter the day of working, we headed to Molly's, second time of the day for me. Jack and Vicky joined us there. Good stress relief after the crazy week. People bitched about everyone that has caused them stress this term. Kyle said he wasn't actually that mad at me, since he trusted I'd get work done. Might have just said it to be nice. He's too nice of a guy. \n\nHe told a story about how he's afraid of cellos. In a previous term he thought it'd be a good idea to rent a cello for a week and learn to play it. When he rented the cello, they asked if he wanted insurance and he said sure. They gave him the massive cello in a backpack sort of thing, and he lugged that on his back to his place. As he climbed the stairs up to his place, he tripped and fell onto the cello, breaking it in half. He brought it back to the store the next day and they were like wtf. The guy at the store said the insurance didn't cover that kind of stuff and Kyle almost shit his pants. Then the owner came and let him off the hook, and even rented him another cello. As Kyle took it home, he took each step with super carefulness. Once he got it home, he couldn't play it since he was scared of breaking it, and so returned it the next morning.\n\nAfter Molly's, the group came back to our place and chilled for a while. Sean, Lux, Jason were still up. I went to go pass out though since had to get up early the next morning.", 1382932800=>"{tasks}\n\n- 90 seconds [re,1]\n\n- Mar Bella [tr,3] ~ Samantha, Kirsten, Shefali\n\n- Sagrada familia [tr,3] ~ Samantha, Kirsten, Shefali\n\n- KFC [so,1] ~ Kirsten\n\n- Magic fountain [tr,2] ~ Samantha, Kirsten, Shefali\n\n- Nap [sl,3]\n\n- Shoko [so,5] ~ Samantha, Kirsten, Shefali\n\n\n\n{deets}\n\n\n\n- Waited for girls to get ready for the day so read in my bed. We finished breakfast at 10, took until noon to leave. Traveling with girls is ridiculous. The waiting for them to do makeup and pick outfits and everything.\n\n\n\n- Everywhere we went the girls were wooed by all the attractive Spanish men. Though I must admit even I was impressed by their looks and good physique. I need to learn how to dress better when I graduate and have a real wardrobe. Also need to get into better shape.\n\n\n\n- When we were at a crazy viewpoint, the girls would be checking out the guys instead of the views. Do not understand.\n\n\n\n- The walking pace was also way too slow for me. But I guess part of traveling is relaxing and compromising.\n\n- Mar Bella was a nude beach. It seemed to only be older people that were going full nude though. The girls went topless, I only went nude right before I jumped into the water, then put it back on when I came out. Not as comfortable as the Europeans. Shefali apparently had a crazy birthday and a crazy trip to myrtle beach. But they refused to tell me details. Quote of the day by Kirsten: \"I wonder how they teach about the holocaust in Germany. I guess it's probably like how they teach about slavery in the states. They don't make the black people leave the classroom or anything.\"\n\n\n\n- Sagrada was absolutely ridiculous. Didn't see much at the top since everything was under construction and there were tons of people trying to get photos. Inside the church everything was mind blowing. I've never seen such a modern looking church. All the crazy polygons and stained glass. I could stare at it for hours.\n\n\n\n- Ate at KFC with Kirsten while the other girls seeked out healthier alternatives. The KFC was delicious. I did feel my arteries being clogged though. We talked about our favorite fast foods and what we missed. \n\n\n\nThe magic fountain wasn't playing. That only goes on Fridays and Saturdays. Once at 7, once at 9. Can't miss it next week. We just checked out the view and then headed back so the girls can take care of their business before we go out for the night. \n\n\n\n- After a nap we went out with the hostels people to a club called opium. Seems to be one of the higher end clubs since it was right by the beach. I wasn't allowed in since I was wearing shorts and running shoes. Apparently that's not allowed. Hostel people should have told us that... Another guy who had foot surgery so he could only wear sandals also wasn't allowed in. Yet the girl he was with wearing sandals was. The group of us went next door to another club called shoko. The girls got in for free. Guys paid €12. Decent music, not great crowd. Good times still just dancing with Kirsten and Shefali. \n\n\n\n\n", 1352264400=>"A day full of interviews.

John was chopping stuff next to me and he accidentally knocked a knife on the floor. I jumped back instinctively. Almost got a knife through my foot.\n\nThroughout the day people came and went. Vicky and Jack came for a bit to watch some soccer. Kyle came and left, then came back again and left. Ryan Tran and his girlfriend chilled pretty much the whole day. Rox's friend from high school Yipei, who apparently is in my graphics class, came for a bit. Linda also. We made patties that looked like different shapes - deadmau5, hearts, penises, boobs, stars. Also made cups out of oranges. John ate a burger in 2 bites and Mary ate one in 3.\n\nNear the end of the day Ryan Zhang, another Jon, and Mary who I'd heard so much about came and separately Rox's friend Amy. The group for the rest of the night were those four, me, xh, Rox, Lucie, Jon, John, Ryan Tran and his girlfriend. We played a drinking game Jon taught us called numbers. You count to an arbitrary number like 12, each person going around in a circle. The person that's supposed to be 12 comes up with a rule for one of the other numbers. If you come up with a rule for a number already with a rule you drink. If you fuck up on your number you drink. If you explain the rules of a number to someone you drink. Reset when someone fucks up, and you end when all the numbers have rules. Had one where instead of saying the number you say the color of your boxers. Rox didn't hear that rule so was super confused and we trolled her the rest of the time for that.\n\nAfterwards played some never have I ever. Apparently Mary has never ridden a bike before. Nothing else was of much surprise.\n\nAfter that, Ryan and his girlfriend left. The rest of us headed to the summer lights festival that was going on in Kitchener. The event wasn't that interesting, though got a chance to talk to Mary. Apparently she had read some of my blog. She finds it interesting reading others' thoughts. The one that she remembered was \"that one where you tell people to spend more money\". Clearly my writing was awful. We found a bar that had beach volleyball and played that for a bit. One of Ryan's friends saw us and joined in. He was kind of an asshole. Was actually good at volleyball and pretty much tried to show off, making it a legit game and stuff. The rest of us were clearly really bad and yet he still kept doing legit serves. After 4 aces, I got tired of that and left. Walked around some, then joined up with them again. Jon and Lucie apparently had been off on their own for the entire time. Jon so good at game. We played some giant jenga and made structures out of plastic connector things. Aside from that, not much excitement from the festival. Not bad for a kitchener even though.\n\nTo end off the night, Jon and John wanted a tour of campus. We tried to show them how ghetto MC is, but it turns out they redid the top floor and now it's super nice. Definitely going to study there in the future.

It was okay.\n\n\n\nConversed with Colleen about if silicon valley is a good thing / the fact that they have lobbyists now, what the purpose of blogging is - to show off? to inform? it pretty much is to show off. you make experiences with your close friends, then you post on social media to show what you've done, the current generation seems to be less materialistic than the ones before? or might just be the bubble we're in. she also reminded me of time when me and Andrew both went running at night and called each other during. \n\nBouldered / did a bit of auto-belaying (failed actual belay test since I wasn't familiar with their equipment).

Met lots of new people - a kid who worked at Tesla who apparently bought a convertible with two months' pay, Holly - an intern at Coursera that I totally thought was a full time, and An - she interned with Ryan before at Amazon and is now at Microsoft. The whole thing got me thinking about how pointless it is to talk to people for just 5 minutes. I'm awful at first impressions so people lose interest after 5 minutes very easily. And I don't have much interest to talk to them since I know it won't be a meaningful conversation and we'll likely not see each other again afterwards.

She and her friend were willing to rent out at a huge loss while a third douchebag roommate insisted on a crazy high price. He was actually the reason Vicky moved out and rented a second place - he played loud music at 3am and smoked weed all the time. If we split the prices three way, it wasn't even that bad, but as a matter of principle we felt like we couldn't agree to it. We debated whether we should rent the two other rooms and try to force the guy's hand and have him rent out for cheaper. Sean and I agreed that'd be the best course of action. Worst case scenario he rents to someone else for full price and one of us finds elsewhere to live. Not a terrible situation. Surprisingly Jason opposed to it though and insisted we pay his demanded price. Our happiness from living together outweighs whatever misery we'd cost the guy. Sean and I agreed Jason's happiness is much more contingent on living arrangements since he doesn't go out as much, so we agreed in the end to do it.\n\n\n\nWent to a conference on Product Management hosted by Paper G. Met one of the founders Victor Wong. That guy had so much charisma talking with him and his friends you just felt so engaged. We talked about things that felt like were on a whole other level of intellect, very reminiscent of the party with Bret Viktor. We were discussing how companies like netflix even though they say they're delivering you the best personalized recommendations with their algorithm, they're really not because their business model heavily influences the recommendations. When they were doing DVDs back in the day, the movies recommended were more of the ones they had more of in stock, and now with streams they show more of the ones they pay less for. Due to licensing they pay per stream for movies and it's different depending on the license they get. It's actually cheaper for them to produce a show like House of Cards than to deal with the licensing stuff.\n\n\n\nWent back to work and played some more guitar.

It's actually quite a easy song.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\n\n\nPM is a mix of soft skills like communication and empathy and hard skills like being logical. When you have a tech background you have more credibility, but it's not necessary for PM jobs and there are other ways to gain credibility. The job is about prioritizing what needs to be done and making sure those do get done. If the product succeeds you succeed. If it fails you fail.

Xuehai sped past the gate where you're supposed to pay the entrance fee. The guy actually tried chasing him down, though he was just casually strolling and not putting in much of an effort. We camouflaged with the tourists to get past him also. The hike was very short, only about 20 minutes and not that intense at all, but at the end we got a good view of waikiki from atop the crater. \n\n\n\nWe hurried back at this point to return the bikes. On the way a newt fell on Jon's neck as he was biking and he freaked out. We were told by some strangers later that this was actually good luck. Newts are protectors of family in Hawaii. After returning the bikes we grabbed lunch nearby at Ruffage at Island's recommendation. I got a pineapple smoothie and ahi poke bowl - the poke was tender and flavorful. We went back to find Island to ask him about where we could rent a car but his shop was completely gone and he was nowhere to be found. I guess that dude just does what he wants.\n\n\n\nWe found a cheap car rental place a bit of a walk away so we headed there. I stopped by the McDonald's along the way to get some pies. Unfortunately taro pies aren't on season, but they did have blueberry and it was still fried. Definitely tasted better than baked. From the car rental place we got a crappy nissan and a jeep wrangler. The jeep was held together at parts by duct tape, super ghetto. Still was mad fun to ride in though.\n\n\n\nWe drove to the trail head which was located in some neighborhood. We weren't sure if it was legit or not, but then we saw a half-naked guy run into the trail so we figured it must be. Also saw a small chameleon right outside. First time seeing one in real life. It didn't do a good job of camouflaging or anything. We walked barely anywhere in the trail and were lost. There was a fork and neither seemed to lead anywhere. After much derpery we found out one of them was indeed a trail, we just missed it since it cliffed down. The scenery was super surreal, when we went through the deep foresty parts it felt like an episode of Lost. The scene would suddenly change once in a while into something drastically different. It eventually became very narrow and prickly and was too much for some of the girls to handle so we stopped. We got some pics with the Canadian flag and as that happened, the people in the group who were behind caught up. We ended up hiking back together with pretty much the full group and took some photos along the way, like one where we spelled out YOLO with our bodies.\n\n\n\nWe returned back to our hotel and parked. When we got into the parking lot, we weren't sure what was going on. A guy at the gate stopped us. We said \"hi\", he responded \"hi\" followed by a silence for a good 10 seconds. We asked what we do about parking and he finally explained how it worked. Such an awkward exchange. Jason did a 7-point U-turn and a 5 point park job, then when we went to dinner after showering, pretty much another couple >3 point turns. \n\n\n\nWe ate at Ruth's Chris Steak since it was Romain's last dinner with us. I ordered pineapple but they thought I meant pineapple juice. Ordered Lyonnaise since it's from Lyon without knowing what it was. Kam ended up asking and spoiling the surprise though - it's stir fried potatoes with onions. Still tasted good. Also got a 16 oz ribeye steak, which pretty much was the most expensive steak I've ever had. At the time I didn't really taste a difference of what was so good about it, but when I had crappy steak the next day, I knew. Don't think I can eat crappy steak again.\n\n\n\n\n", 1392786000=>"First yoga class. The teacher, Deb, was really informative and hands on in helping.

She brought me bubble tea from up in North York where she was just playing badminton, I don't remember what the place was called but the bubble tea was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweetness and the tapioca was quite tasty.\n\nWe went into the pharmacy building to check out the orbs. Checked out the nice view from the top floor and looked down. She commented how the seats some floors down would be great for a stop motion taken from up there. I like the way she thinks. We checked out the orbs, then went to Hart House.\n\nShe tried explaining how there was an amazing room with stained glass and hogwarts epicness inside. We looked all over and could not find it. U of T does have crazy architecture though. I am impressed.\n\nIt turned out the epic room was not in Hart House as she thought, but next door. The room was indeed epic. We sat in there and talked about life for about 3 hours. Why we majored in what we did, our families, how our parents met, how trivial things were in high school. We realized it was pretty late / we should eat food when the place got dark and the lights turned on. We walked to and ate at Kensington Bistro. Talked about relationships, our life stories, school clubs. Didn't realize how late it was until the owner told us he was closing. It was way later than we thought, I was going to be late for the bus.\n\nWe hurried as fast as we could to get to the greyhound station. I had to sprint the last bit. Luckily the bus was a bit late in leaving and I got there just in time to plead for the driver to wait for me.

By then it was already too late and sold out. Instead we ran to the ramenritto shop, which turned out to be at a tea shop. The place was super tea decorated, and they just happened to also sell ramenrittos. Ramenrittos were exactly as expected - ramen in burritos. Tasted quite good. Makes sense since noodles very easily replaces rice.\n\nVisited Facebook NYC with Felix, the group, and Mo. Felix went back to work, feel pretty bad since we already kind of screwed him over. Shopped around the area as we walked down to Wall Street. Linda got hit on by super nice black people giving away their music and she felt scared for her life, I bought a domo shirt at Yellow Rat Bastard, Rox bought lots of lulzy stuff from there. Cool store with hilarious original shirts, if only the shirts were better quality.\n\nWe got the typical touristy photo in front of the bull, walked down Wall Street and chilled outside the stock exchange. There were some French tourists and I eavesdropped in on them talking.\n\nChecked out the 9/11 memorial and then High Line.\n\nBy then it was already getting to be pretty late so we went to get food. Andrew bailed again. Rox already didn't trust that he'd show up and told us to not plan around him. I still had my hopes up, but looks like I was wrong.\n\nAfter dinner it was just about time for the Daniel Radcliffe play - Cripple of Inishmaan. Acting was solid, but the plot was pretty lame and the dialogue awful. The other three all fell asleep at some point. I definitely only like broadway when there's music involved. As we left there were fans lining up outside. It turns out Daniel Radcliffe comes out from there and people were lining up to get his autograph. We didn't manage to get close enough, but we did get some pictures of him taking selfies with other fans. That, and learning that I don't like normal broadway I think made the experience worth the money.\n\nThe play got us in the mood for ramen. We went searching for the Benkei place Felix had told us about the night before. Xuehai led the way and brought us to a super white looking restaurant called Hill and Dale with really white looking decor and music. We thought for sure he screwed up. When we entered, there was a sign saying that after midnight, they served ramen. Apparently the ramen chef didn't want to pay NY rent for a whole place, so he just borrows this place's kitchen at night. When we looked around, we noticed Aaron Pang and his friends were there. Super coincidence bumping into them. Tried talking to them, but they pretty much ignored us. Only responding when we asked questions, otherwise just talking amongst themselves. So we said screw that, and just went to our own table and did our own thing. We ordered ramen and requested a song - Counting Stars. The ramen turned out to be one of the best I've had, and they actually played our requested song. We were super excited so we requested to take a selfie with our waiter. We also put up the coffee poster Rox bought for the lulz. The waiter must have thought we were pretty cool, he bought us a round of free shots. Never had that happen before. The waiter's name was Ivan. We requested another song, and ordered more ramen. Got a round of pickle back - a New York specialty drink. It's a shot of whiskey chased by a shot of pickle juice. I wasn't able to take the whole shot of pickle juice. When our other requested song got played, we went nuts. By this point we were one of the only people left in the place. The bartender came to us after and introduced himself. His name was Lawrence. He also bought us a round of shots. We went to the center of the bar since no one else was around and danced there. Lawrence, upon hearing we were from Waterloo, said his girlfriend's from Kitchener. Super crazy. Also he's a musician - Lawrence Trailer. He serenaded us with some of his music while we danced. Definitely one of the most memorable bar experiences I've had. I'd totally become a regular of the place if I lived in NY.\n\nWhen we got back to our apartment, Xuehai and I climbed the fire escape. Fear of heights kicked in and the view wasn't anything spectacular, so I gtfo-ed shortly after.

The building's architecture and all the female museum-goers were all great. The art not so much. There were a couple exhibits I liked - the ones involving photography, dance, and romanticism. Basically all the things that are more real and less left up to interpretation. Interpretation is cool and all, but often other people's interpretations are very farfetched and seem like complete bullshit. And I mean if its something that looks completely deformed / like a 5 year old could have drawn it, sure it lets me see how the artist viewed the world, but that does not impress me. The main exhibit by Cindy Sherman will give me nightmares. Crazy looking clowns and people with both genitalia, I don't even understand.\n\n\n\nAt night we ate dinner at la folie.

I probably should have paid more attention to what else was served so I could describe them delectably and stuff. Guess I'll try to do it next time. We acted quite immaturely the entire time, making bad jokes and all. Fancy restaurants definitely are not for us. The chef came out at the end to talk to us.

Before Pixar, at every Siggraph there'd be cool demoes of balls rolling on checkerboards, etc, but there weren't any plots to the animations. When Pixar showed the Luxo animation, it got standing ovations from the very beginning. People who worked on it were like wut, how will the audience react when it gets to the actual funny parts? Pretty crazy how Pixar could make an inanimate lamp feel alive through its shaking motions, etc. You genuinely could feel the emotions they conveyed. After the Luxo showing, a super renowned graphics person approached John Lasseter. He was like oh crap, he's going to ask me something about the cell shading. I don't know any of the technical details about that. Instead the guy asked \"was the big lamp a mother or a father?\". That was when he knew they succeeded. Pixar used to be a hardware company that made special rendering computers for medical / military applications. Under Steve Jobs they pivoted to the animation. Even to this day they still do shorts before the full length films because its the core of what made the company. The shorts also give newcomers a chance to try major roles like producing and directing.

We had to delay the event 30 minutes to fix it.\n\n\n\nThen came event time, where I helped with the camera work. The event was so much more organized this year, we each had an earpiece, in which Tom directed us in how we should do the cameras, and told us which one was going live - the event was live broadcasted through the same cameras as they were being recorded unlike the previous year. \n\n\n\nAfter the event we cleaned up the place and headed over to Kickoffs. Had some beers with some of the speakers and called it a night.\n\nRichard Holmes is a very interesting guy, He also does a daily journal except he makes sure that he does it everyday. It doesn't take THAT long and it's good to get into a habit. He records 3 things he's thankful for that day, a brief list of what he did that day and whether they were towards his goals, things he learned, and some others I don't remember anymore. I think I'll start doing the same.\n\n\n\n\n", 1370750400=>"Tennis with Jack and Jason. Jack is pretty good, also super ripped.

A bit overpriced but pretty good food.\n\nChilled with Victoria for a while until fire alarm went off. Discussed her and my issues.\n\n\n\nWent to play board games with Gaurav Ivan Jennelle and her friends Chris and Brandon til 2:30am. Had a pretty epic wheat port + monopoly + 2 6s on wheat situation going on, but ended up losing to Chris who had an 8 on ores and ore port, which got rolled more often. Also got in a couple short games of monopoly deals here and there. That game is too OP\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nA guy overdosed on salt by drinking a quart of soy sauce on a dare.

Met up with Leslie and ate at Panera. She and Brian are dating again. She's double majoring in Anthro and Information Science. Got a full time job at Fidelity Investment already. Her life seems pretty much the same as before.\n\nWhile walking with Leslie around campus looking for a pretty place to take a snapchat, bumped into Steven Buccini, who coincidentally wanted to meet up. He had an interview so we didn't really talk much. Walked with Leslie to Davie Poplar and then went to her place. Jessica was busy with DOTA. She met her boyfriend through it it seems, and they hung out when she was in Europe. Brian came by and we played Settlers til Randy came to pick me up.\n\nWent with Randy to Lydia's place, where Sean, Aanya, and Hannah met us. We grilled some steaks, turkey burgers, asparagus with bacon, and other veggies. They talked about some of their drunken adventures, we reminisced about shenanigans at summer ventures / post-svsm parties - the night at Sean's where Hannah asked for \"him\" all night and Andrew threw me against a wall, night we tried to sneak out after curfew to have a sleepover with everyone, time we all took a shot from a film canister and Andrew was tipsy already, the beetle night, how Randy won the prize for best report despite starting the night before at like 2am. Rani apparently unfriended some of us on Facebook and we expressed our outrage for a while.\n\nWent back to campus then met up with Shank, George, Andrew at Sakura. Very crappy japanese food. Went back to Brian and George's place. Pretty much everyone has a really nice house and all of their rents are below $300/month. At Brian's we watched the Avengers while talking about life. Leslie and Jessica showed up too. Brian's other roommate Suraj left with Jamie for some bar hopping. Sean and Lydia popped by but left after a bit to do the same. Simon dropped by and we played some Liar's Poker. Then we went to Harris Teeter to get some late night snacks. Andrew showed us a geocache that was near the Harris Teeter.\n\nWe went back and talked about life some more. Trying to help Shank be happier with life. Trying to understand Asian culture. Andrew says he wouldn't date an Asian girl because he'd feel guilty. We came to America to diversify, it'd be wrong to stay confined within the Asian circle.\n\n\n\n\n", 1397275200=>"Team offsite in the morning. We waited downstairs of Dan's apartment since he was driving us, but he overslept and Justin had to go wake him up. Offsite was in Santa Cruz area - Mount Hermon Redwoods canopy tour. A lot more fun and physically exhausting than I expected. One that felt particularly scary was where you had to jump onto a rope and swing to another platform. Even though we were strapped in, the feeling of jumping over a gap some 100ft above the ground scares me. Some you had to rely on your partner - holding onto them to get across to the other side - and the whole push-pull factor had a lot of symbolism in terms of team-building. Overall, probably wouldn't do again but enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nAfterwards we debated where to go for lunch and I suggested Mission st bbq. Can never get tired of that place. Me and Sotolongo split 1 lb of tri tip steak and pulled pork and a loaf of garlic bread. So good. Dan W was supposed to drive us back but he was so tired from staying up the night before that he passed out at Misison St. We chilled for a bit longer before heading back. The night before they played a game of poker with no action, loser drinking each time. So degen. Dan dropped me off in Santa Clara and I got picked up there by Kris.\n\nPhil and Tommy arrived around the same time and we went grocery shopping for the trip. Then headed to dinner at Orenchi. Orenchi had a long line, so while we waited we went to a nearby grocery store and played the shopping game - name 3 times, then the first one to find all three wins. We decided a better game would be if named 3 abstract items and the one to find the most original version of the three wins. Otherwise we're all headed to the same aisles. Orenchi wasn't quite up to my standards for ramen, but we got to get a polaroid photo taken that is put onto the wall. For our quote we wrote something from Memento. Still haven't seen the movie so I didn't get the reference. Went back to Kris' place and made sandwiches. We got an assembly line going for making the sandwiches and made about 20 of them.\n\nPlayed Settlers of Catan with drinking on every 7. Game ended pretty close, we were all in the 8 point range. We also listened to Sail and drank every time the word 'sail' was said. Surprising how often that happens. I laughed so hard during it while drinking that I spat everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n", 1348891200=>"Watched two documentaries tonight with Jason, Stephane, Nicole. First was about Evolutionary Arms Race, and the other was about ants. Ants are so cool!\n\n\n\nCool things learned:- There's a species of bacteria that are eaten by shrimp. They work together with cuttlefish who eat the shrimp by lighting up shrimp after being consumed so that cuttlefish can eat the shrimp. GANGING UP ON THE MIDDLE MAN.\n\n\n\n- A species of clams has an appendage that looks like a little fish and it wiggles around to entice bass. Bass try to eat it and then the clam sprays its eggs into the bass. The eggs feed off of the bass's blood and grow up.\n\n\n\n- Dragonfly nymphs eat tadpoles. A species of them, when eaten, sprays out warning fluids that transforms all the other tadpoles in the vicinity into bigger, faster ones.\n\n- Octopi change body structure and color to look like predators / surroundings\n\n\n\n- Terminator-like spider (porsha) which hunts other spiders by pretending to be pray and shaking the web, and when that doesn't work, ambushing from above\n\n- Poisonous newts are becoming more and more poisonous, strong enough to kill hundreds of people now. This is because gardner snakes that eat them are becoming more and more resistant. After a gardner snake eats a newt, it goes comatose for a few hours from the poison. At this time they have second hand poison.\n\n\n\n- Ants build colonies that can be as small as an acorn or as large as kilometers, which is the equivalent of the great wall of china in their scale.\n\n- They domesticate aphids for honeydew, team up with pitcher plants to get food/provide protection\n\n\n\n- People have built really cool experiments to test and learn from ants - have them run on a little ball while spraying them with chemicals (ants follow chemical trails to get around. its how their management system works), spinning them in centrifuges (they can stick to walls even when spinning at speeds 30x what would kill us), putting them upside down and then having them carry weights (they can lift up to 100 times their weight, even while sticking to the ceiling)\n\n\n\n- They can rebuild colonies in just 2 days after it gets destroyed. Some species have to hold down the female ants to keep them from flying away when this happens, some joust it out to see who's the new queen\n\n\n\n- They specialize in their tasks, some just cut leaves, some just carry them back to the homes, some just clean the larva rooms, etc\n\n- They use tree resin as soap to sanitize\n\n- They have amazing traffic systems, but when the surrounding is burnt and the chemical trails are lost, they are in chaos\n\n\n\nAlso, it's ribs night at Eric's place!\n\n\n\n\n", 1368936000=>"Terry drove me, Jessica, Mark to Angel Hack\n\nWe spent the longest time deciding on an idea, then ended up rewriting Entwine Food served was pretty crappy - they ran out of pizza pretty early.

In between classes was going to do work but didn't really end up doing anything. Was feeling kind of sad from everything still and just wanted to nap. Crazy how much my mood affects everything else in my life.\n\nGot Harvey's for dinner and super splurged. Got poutine, pop tart ice cream sandwich (need to make this myself in the future, such a good idea), milkshake. Ended up having a bad allergic reaction to the milkshake. Should probably stop eating those now.\n\nDuring algo got a message from Alex from nest. I called her after class and it turned out I got the offer. I wasn't sure whether to take it or not, so decided to talk it out with my parents.\n\nWent for a swim and ran into Ryan Zhang there. Seems we'll be swimming buddies now. For their FYDP they're building the exact opposite of what we're building. They're building a glove that when you touch real objects creates them in VR. \n\nDuring call with parents, they helped me make my decision. Only PM jobs on jobmine are Microsoft and Google. I don't know if I'd want to work at Microsoft and Google I don't know if I could get. Stripe I'd want to work at because the people are awesome and there's huge potential. I don't care at all about payments though. So Nest seems like a good choice.\n\nI realized I've had the exact same pattern for jobs every term. I'd get two jobs that I feel like I'm going to get, and then I decide I want one more than the other. Then I get a rejection from that company and offer from the other, and feel crappy about not getting the one I wanted more. Then I end up loving the job I did get.

Mark met us at Best Buy to return my backpack to me. We thought we saw Mark walking towards us but it was actually an old Indian dude who walked similarly to Mark.Helped dad fix the garage. We had to break the drywall, stick in new wood, and hammer some metal. Dad had to do all the actual handy stuff, I just helped with grunt work. He really is handy.\n\n\n\nMom taught me how to make proper dumpling stuffing. You need lots of ginger, eggs, quite a bit of sesame/vegetable oil, some water or chicken broth, salt.\n\nWent to Andrew Wu's place for dinner party. Andrew Lee was there also, as well as other people I didn't know. Wu had generally good times while traveling around Asia. He experienced a lady boys strip club and actually thought they were attractive before he found out they were lady boys. Scary. He also went to a ping pong show. Apparently they don't just do ping pong balls. They also shoot darts through balloons. His internship sounded pretty legit also, he wants to work on wall street after graduating. Lee's doing well too. Did an internship and now is back in Chapel Hill for pharm school. We played 007 Night Fire for a while, then played liar's poker. Pretty interesting game - everyone starts out with 1 card. You go around the table declaring what you think the highest \"poker hand\" on the table is. Let's say the first person says \"5 high card\". The next person can raise, say \"7 high card\", or call their bluff. If they call their bluff, everyone reveals their cards. If indeed \"5 high card\" exists amongst all the cards on the table, the person that called bluff incorrectly gets another card next round. If the person did lie, they get another card. When someone reaches 7 cards they lose. 3 pairs and 2 triples also count as poker hands. Straight and flush do not. Straight flush does though.\n\n\n\n\n", 1398398400=>"At Tea time during the Q&A some random dude that I didn't know walked up and asked Dick in front of the whole company \"the interns are leaving soon and I heard they wanted to get a selfie with you. Would you be up for that at the end of tea time?\" All of us were in shock and were spamming the chat saying wtf just happened who is this guy? Turned out it was a coworker that sarah mentioned the selfie thing to once. So we did end up getting the selfie with Dick, just not through the way we anticipated.\n\nWatched Agents of Shield. I wish I had someone to talk about it with. It's actually getting pretty crazy.\n\nSkyped with Jamie about what I should do for next coop. He says Hacker School doesn't sound like a good investment. I could at any point take 4 months off to do that. But I wouldn't be able to take 4 months off to do a PM job and then just quit. I'll decide when offers roll around whether I want to work at a pre-IPO startup to invest for the future or if I want to work at a PM gig.\n\nPlayed some smash with the Dan Huang and Dan Wang and Ben.\n\n\n\n\n", 1375848000=>"Crazy 316 exam.

He doesn't value words or gifts since he was raised without any of that. Same for me I find. Xuehai pointed out that no one else in the world really has allergies. Only people in North America.

And I very evidently don't have much patience when I try to debate with him on that area\n\nAfter lunch I didn't have much productivity. Derped around on the internet, did some video editing, took a nap\n\nThen Patrick and zach came. We ate at sun Kwon and pre drank at my place. Shots of fireball, the Roxanne game. That game gets you drunk ridiculously fast. By the time we left our place the concert had already been about two hours in, which seemed alright since usually the opener takes an hour and a half or so.\n\nBy the time we got to the concert, Ellie was playing \"anything can happen\", and afterwards she announced the next one would be her last song. We were like oh crap... Guess the opener didn't play for long or something. She ended with \"lights\", then did \"burn\" for the encore and another song I don't remember. She was a really good performer. Much more attractive in person, and her accent is great. For anything can happen she did some sexual gestures everytime she said anything can happen. And for burn she pulled out a bass guitar. Quite great. Shame we missed most of it. \n\nAfter the concert we decided to head to local edition. On the way there Pat talked up some girls walking beside us. I asked them to join us at the bar, which Pat considered a ballsy move. He said he'd have done it probably a couple sentences later. They said they're not old enough, they're 20, but would be down to stop by a grocery store and have us buy them cigarettes. Kinda sketch since that probably means they're actually not even 18.\n\nLocal edition had too long of a line so we went to Otis across the street instead. The tv was playing poker world tour ladies night. Very attractive females, but they didn't seem to be playing that well. At least that's what it seemed in my drunken state watching it without any sound. We chilled at the bar for a bit and some crazy girl tried talking us up.\n\nAfter we headed to the Grand. Patrick really had to pee, and so we detoured by a parking lot. \"You know what that P stands for right?\". Unfortunately we couldn't get in because Patrick was wearing shorts, so we headed back towards Local edition. Pat and Zach were talking to chicks on tinder the whole time we walked and one of the people that messaged zach was actually a guy. We drunkenly messaged back \"duuuude!\" and that became a running gag the rest of the night, as well as \"wo xiang qing ni zhen me yang?\".\n\nLocal edition also wouldn't let pat in so we headed back and called it a night", 1374811200=>"Chilled in E5 with Vicky, Carlie, Lux. Had a short bonding moment with Vicky about girlsWent to toastmasters meeting - apparently the final one every term is always themed Upside Down. Basically the entire thing was done in reverse and is super hectic. Since it goes backwards, the table topic evaluator \"thanked\" the people who did the talks before the actual talks, so I was basically assigned a talk. I was to talk about during midterms how I got sick. I gave a super short talk about being pregnant. Definitely need to get better at going into more details and making eye contact.\n\n\n\nSpoke with Amir about startups and he had an awesome idea - a dashboard to keep track of numbers on other websites. You assign it dom elements and then when those elements update, it updates on your dashboard, so you basically have a dashboard of all the numbers of whatever else you care about on websites\n\n\n\nAmir gave an amazing and unexpected self expression about how he used to have anger issues. He talked about the time he first got suspended for getting angry at someone and burning their homework, and about the time he punched a hole in the wall from anger from starcraft. He said that you wouldn't expect it from talking to him since he seems so chill because people are very good at hiding what's underneath, there's always more than meets the eyes. That's why he never judges people by first impressions. Ended with a quote: \"Never make decisions when you're angry, never make promises when you're happy\". The whole speech felt so relatable. I want to give a speech on being a chronic quitter next time.\n\n\n\nAfter the meeting ended we had games night. First we played telephone charades very briefly - basically the game from the Wong Fu game show video. Then we played a very interesting word version of mafia. There's 3 teams - good, bad, idiots. You're given a word and that represents your team (though you don't know which team your word is from). There's roughly twice as many good as there are bad/idiots. The idiots have a very similar word to the good, and the bad have a completely different word. Example: plant, tree, hope. Superman, spiderman, budweiser. You go around in a circle and during your turn and give a description of your word. Once you go around, everyone together votes off a person or two, depending on how big the group is. When all the bad people are voted off, the good guys / idiots win. At any point, the bad guys can call out what they think the good guys' word is. If they call it out correctly, they win. If they don't that person is auto voted off. So the good people can't give too detailed of descriptions and the bad people want to lie / be vague to pretend to be good guys so they don't get voted off. \n\n\n\nThe first round the words were memories, childhood, pig. That one it got super obvious that it was memories, but not everyone completely understood the rules so the good guys won. The second round the words were food, smell, brown. Probs would've been better with food, drink, brown. I was on the bad guys team and managed to survive quite a few rounds with vague descriptions. I wasn't able to last til the end though. Jessie did and she was one of the last 3 so bad guys won! It was mostly because people were super confused since food and smell weren't that similar.\n\n\n\nWent for drinks at McGinnis since it was Edbert's birthday. David, Paul, Ignacio, Christina was with us. We didn't drink much but the conversation was very interesting. It felt very homey. We got in depth about relationships, how to tell when girls / guys are interested in you, parenting, and all sorts of other stuff. Paul especially is a very deep guy, though everyone was amazing. There's so much hidden meaning behind what people say in Asian cultures. \"we don't say I love you, we say are you hungry\". When you're living at home, if you stay out overnight, it feels empty for your loved ones at home, they get a sinking feeling. Things like that, it's hard to consider when you're young. Hard to think about if you'd do anything differently when you become a parent.\n\n\n\n\n", 1363838400=>"TIL:\n\nJava strings are immutable, as well as other primitives in Java.

Anthony came later. We tried opening a bottle of wine, but didn't have a corkscrew, so tried a variety of methods involving all sorts of tools / tried banging the bottle against a wall.

The kind you go on with someone you don't know to see if there's any chemistry, then the romantic kind once you've established there's chemistry. The first kind could just be coffee or something simple. The latter is more elaborate usually.

Then today they publicly announced the new photo tagging feature but hadn't rolled it out to everyone when they did because of a bad deploy.\n\n\n\nAfter work was poker night. At first we played 10 people at one table, then when more showed up we split into two tables. Table of 5 is completely different play from table of 10. For most of the game I was up by a lot, probably double my buy-in, but I guess that's not necessarily a sign of winning poker. I was still irrationally raising a lot of the times and playing a bit loose, but I'm not good at sitting around doing nothing. I noticed more when other people were being the aggressor / predicting their hands, but often I was still wrong, and with 10 people at a table I could only figure out a couple of the people. A couple times I re-raised but not enough to get people to fold, and then folded myself after the flop. Definitely crappy moves.\n\n\n\nSome of the bad hands that cost me big:\n\nAK suited. 30 in the pot I bet 50 pre flop. One opponent calls. He's playing very loose. Flop is 379 offsuit or something awful like that. Opponent raises 50. I call since I have pot odds. River is more crap. Opponent goes all in, which is another 200. I fold. He has AK unsuited. Dan says I made the right call.\n\n\n\nI have JQ suited in position. Flop is AQ something. I raised preflop I think 15 or 25. I cbet something. I think 100? Opponent calls so I figure he has Q but may think I have A. Turn is another A. I raise 250 to make him think I for sure have A. He goes all in. He had KQ and wins. That hand cost me big.\n\n\n\nAnother costly hand but I'm thinking was the right call. A9 suited in position. Raise 15. He calls. Flop is AJ7. I raise 50. He raises me all in. I don't have much left so I shove. He has J8. River is 8 so he wins, but that's -EV on his part?\n\n\n\n\n", 1404446400=>"Gave persuasive speech on why you should attend a music festival.

The hike was through Kungsleden, a 200km endeavor, all the while carrying backpacks of supplies - clothes, food, water, compass, and other necessities. Some days they wouldn't see a single other traveler. They only carried a half liter of water each for emergencies. Most of the time they drank from the stream. There was a day the stream looked and tasted like hot piss. Oliver has a pill that makes water drinkable, but he said it makes it taste like chlorine so it was either hot piss or cold chlorine. Not very pleasant either way.\n\nApparently when North Americans go to Germany they paperbag their drinks and it looks completely ridiculous. It really doesn't make sense why we can't drink openly in public, enjoy a nice beer in the park or something. The people who'd be obnoxious would be doing it anyways.\n\nWe discussed the differences between the German and North American education systems in length and played some cards. It seems the Canadian system is better if you know what you want to do since it helps you specialize better, whereas German's system is better if you don't. They do agree fourth grade is a bit too early for children to be placed in categories based on their intelligence which sets their track for the rest of their lives, but there does appear to be quite a bit of potential for mobility. Corvin used to be in the apprentice track but through extra schooling he was able to move to the university track.\n\nI taught them Liar's Poker and they taught us a German game and a Russian game which apparently both translate to Shithead.\n\nThe German game: each player has three cards face down, with three cards face up on top of them, then three cards in your hand. At the beginning you can swap out the cards in your hand with the ones face up in front of you. The game then starts. I forget who starts first initially but afterwards the player to the right of the loser starts. The player puts down a card/doubles/triples. The next player has to put down a higher card (even if the previous person played doubles, you don't have to). If they can't, they pick up the entire pile and their turn is skipped. 2 resets the pile, 10 burns the pile (the player then gets to play another card), 3 is an invisible number so the person who plays next plays based on the card below the 3, 7 makes it so the next person has to play a card lower than 7. 7 can only be played if the highest number is below 7, the others can be played any time. 4 is the lowest number, ace is the highest. If 4 of a kind are played consecutively, could be through multiple players, the person to play the fourth burns the pile. When you have less than 3 cards in your hand, you draw til you have 3. Once you run out of cards, you play the three on your table face up. After you run out of those, you randomly pick one of the face down ones and play with that. The loser is the last person to run out of cards.\n\nThe Russian game: All cards lower than 6 are removed from the deck. Each player gets six cards, and one card is flipped face up and placed at the bottom of the deck. The face up one's suit determines the trump. The player with the 6 of the trump suit starts the game (all following games the player to the right of the loser starts). The player attacks the person to their left with a card/doubles/triples/quads. That player can either play a card with the same number to move the attack to the player to their left, or can defend against the attacks by playing cards of higher numbers from the respective suit / trump suit. When that attack ends, players from both sides of the defender can attack more, up to 6 attacks in total (or however many cards that player has left in their hand). The attacks can only use numbers already in play, either from the attackers or defenders. If the defender successfully fends off all attacks, the pile is burned and it's their turn. If they fail, they pick up all the cards and skip their turn. Everyone involved picks up cards to replenish their hand up to 6. The attacker does the picking up first. Like the other game it ends when all players except one run out of cards.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nDropbox has to use tons of hacks to bypass OSX restrictions \n\n\n\n\n", 1406088000=>"From Saturday til today, everyday has pretty much been wake up -> work on graphics -> eat while thinking about graphics -> work on graphics -> sleep -> repeat.\n\nMy process began as try to find other people's code snippets, try to rework to fit my code.

Everyone took turns with the rage panda. It really brought people together since whenever someone wandered off they could find their way back due to the panda\n\nKnife party there were too many people. Someone was throwing fake money and people were bending over to pick it up. Pretty annoying so I left to check out silent disco instead. Everyone was sitting down though. Guess they were all tired from knife party. The Dj wasnt great either, kinda ruined the experience.\n\n\n\n\n", 1402459200=>"Dinner with Jamie - talked about ups and downs of cottage, what are actually hard problems we work on during internships, graphics\n\nWent to the theater at 7 for The Fault in Our Stars and found out it was already sold out. Bought a ticket for edge of tomorrow instead for 7:30, then realized why are we here to see a movie we don't actually want to see. So instead returned the tickets and instead got tickets for the 10pm showing for tfios. Xuehai swapped out the ticket for a 10pm showing of edge of tomorrow. He decided he'd rather see that with that group instead. Super fail mess of a movie watching\n\n10pm met back up at conestoga for the movie. The first half was mediocre, definitely weren't the target audience / lots of details from the book left out. Second half was really good. Spot on acting / writing for jerking emotions. I teared up a bit. At one point there was complete silence in the theater and you could hear people sobbing. I almost burst out laughing.\n\n\n\n\n", 1396929600=>"Skyped with mom and grandparents.

Milan is massive, yet doesn't have that much to offer. Duomo is quite a crazy cathedral. I spent a while looking at the impressive architecture, but Eric kept wanting to leave and making comments that annoyed me. When I pointed out the architecture, he said he didn't even notice that. Blows my mind how he can travel so much yet still not see any of that\n\nI'm awful at hiding when I don't like someone and Eric clearly picked up on it throughout the day. He headed to San Marino early. The rest of the time I was with just the Belgian guy and we had a hard time talking. I couldn't really understand his french and my french is still awful.\n\nEverything turned out to be closed, the weather was complete crap, so I headed to the train station super early. This turned out to be lucky because I noticed the train didn't appear on the schedule. Turned out I was at the wrong station and was able to get to the right one in time because I was so early.\n\n\n\n\n", 1392094800=>"Clay and Tiffany came to visit after work. Really good seeing them again! Ate at Twitter, played some DDR, then went to Smittens\n\n\n\n\n", 1405310400=>"When we woke up we headed to Squealing Pig to get breakfast. Mark and Eric joined us there. Talked about our pet peeves. Mine are people being late, people asking how to say something in Chinese, and smoking. I also don't like it when girls wear black socks. Completely irrational I know.\n\nWalked around the area that supposedly has a ton of bars looking for a place to watch the Brazil World Cup finals - Germany vs Argentina. The bar Mark and Patrick wanted to go to wouldn't allow Canadian IDs unless they were passports. Ended up going to a bar that the locals didn't think too highly of, but we didn't have much time before the game started to find another place, and there was space at that one. The game was anticlimactic for the main part. A couple minutes near the end had some craziness. I still don't really understand people getting together to watch sports.\n\nWe went down to the Charles River and walked along it, derping around with the various statues and such along the way. Rented kayaks at the first place we found and kayaked down the Charles River. Good workout, pretty views. A nice change of pace from all the alcohol consumption. For dinner we had a BBQ at Patrick's place. He has a sick roof patio. We made burgers, kebabs, and ice cream sandwiches. Played some Project M with Anthony and Dave. Dave's a bit worse than me. Anthony consistently 2 stocked me. Project M is awesome. Characters all balanced very well, so could play my normal melee characters along with the brawl ones I liked, and was still fair. The music and stages also all very nicely done.\n\nBoston guys went to bed since they had class the next morning. We chilled and rated girl and guy friends amongst our FB friends. Marco Nigris and Daniel Piedrahita got the highest ratings amongst my friends. Other than that, none of us guys could agree with ratings the girls gave.\n\nWhen we went to bed, we told Xuehai he could sleep anywhere since he was probably going to be driving the most the next day. And yet he chose to sleep on the table again. We thought it hilarious.\n\n\n\n\n", 1405396800=>"Visited Harvard. Beautiful campus with a good mix of modernity and rich oldness. We went to the souvenir shop and I thought about buying a shirt, but they weren't very good quality. Decided instead to buy a deck of cards. I'm going to start collecting cards from places I travel to now.\n\nGrabbed lunch at Russel House. Possibly the best ahi tuna sandwich I've had. The sauce they used tasted fantastic and melded very well with the tuna. Their grilled chicken sandwich was also spot on\n\nChilled in the Harvard Yard. There were food trucks there and we grabbed some ice cream. It was made with liquid nitrogen, and when we asked about it they said the owner got the idea from San Francisco.\n\nOn the drive home we talked about watching porn, one night stands, masterbation. It seems girls don't really need porn to masterbate, they just let their imagination make it happen.\n\nAround dinner time, we were pretty much at Syracuse again, thought it fitting to hit up Dinosaur BBQ. There was a crazy downpour the last bit of the drive to Syracuse. We ordered the family combo that had a bit of everything. Like last time, I thought the ribs were mediocre but the chicken was phenomenal. Xuehai and Rox still didn't agree. Anthony also didn't. Lucie did though and we were orgasming the whole time about how amazing the chicken was, how our lives were changed and it felt like there was a god. The chicken really was the perfect amount of moist and flavorfulness. No idea how they did that. Two blonde girls sat at the table behind us and we all rated them to be high 8s. After the meal ended, we looked at them again and were like whoa, they're not even 7s. We decided amazing food adds a bonus to ratings. Kind of like beer goggles. When we stepped outside, there was a perfect rainbow in the sky. Everything felt magical at that point. The rest of the drive back, the magic continued. Birds flying across the sky, a gorgeous sunset, all of which while we blasted Asian music. Felt surreal. At one point Xuehai's car lights dimmed down on its own for some reason. Anthony freaked out a bit because he thought the car just turned off. And yet we were still going. \"It's all good as long as you can see the D\".\n\nWhen we got near the border, we tried to find gas and took a wrong turn. It put us close to Niagara Falls so we figured might as well detour there. Never seen the falls from the American side. The view isn't nearly as good as the Canadian side, but you can see it from right above, and its crazy how much water is pouring down.\n\n\n\n\n", 1389589200=>"Visited the Natural science museum, supposed to have the largest dinosaur collection in all of Europe. Indeed, there were over 30 complete dinosaurs, and the leg of one monstrous one. It's surprising to think about how big certain animals are, and of course about how massive dinosaurs are. I need to look into how fossilization works. Everything looks fake after being fossilized.\n\n\n\nAfter the museum we went to meet up with Jenna and Marianne at the subway. It was the no pants subway ride that afternoon. The first ever in Brussels. It ended up being quite disappointing - highly disorganized, tons of media involved, people were not at all inconspicuous.\n\n\n\nJenna then took us to what she considers the best waffles in Brussels, which turned out to be next to the famous pissing boy statue. We actively avoided looking at it. It's one of those stupid tourist traps we want no part of. Apparently there are 3 stories behind it:\n\n\n\n1. a boy ran away and the dad said he'll make a statue of whatever the boy was doing when he was found\n\n2. a boy peed from a tree on nazis during occupation and became immortalized for it\n\n3. a witch froze the boy doing that to punish him for something or another\n\n\n\nThere's also a pissing girl and a pissing dog statue in other parts of the town.\n\nThen we headed to a couple of local bars. Le Cercueil is a death-themed bar where the tables are coffins and the lighting was extremely dim. Jenna commented we probably wouldn't get another chance to put our feet up on a coffin. There was one drink served in an hour glass shaped mug and another served from a horn.\n\n\n\nAfterwards we went to Delirium. They hold the world record for most beers in the bar. They have over 2000 different kinds. We tried so many\n\nAfter a couple hours we parted ways with them to catch our train to paris. When we got to paris everything was closed so we just chilled at the hostel's bar. The people in our hostel room seemed like they were high as hell. Their speech crawled at a snail's pace and they talked about I don't even know what.\n\n\n\nAs the bar was going to close, Sean convinced me we should talk to the girls watching the football match. I still have massive fear of rejection it seems. Talking to groups of people I'm already with, and talking to people just to get to know them is fine also. But if I'm approaching, it's completely different. In the end I just thought fuck it, I'm leaving tomorrow. No harm done. The two girls were from Colorado. The Asian one was named ginger and the other named kursty? When I commented kursty sounds like a mix between... She was drinking something and it exploded out of her mouth all over me. We spent the rest of the night walking around the city and talking with them. That went on until 6am. Sean was certain ginger wanted to get some, since she suggested we keep the night going and play some card games or something. Who knows.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nStegosaurs have the plates on their back for cooling purposes\n\n\n\n\n", 1362974400=>"House of Air - super awesome. Definitely want to go again.

Pretty hilarious, hopefully the photographers will send us the photos / footage free of charge\n\n\n\nGrabbed dinner with Mc, Romain, Nick, Khallil and Joey at Bissou - pretty good french food, a bit on the expensive side. Like between $$ and $$$\n\nOn way home an old homeless lady chased me with her garbage bag. She yelled at me saying \"Get out of my house!! I wouldn't go into yours, so why are you in mine?

Their buffet is very meh compared to Cici's. Want to try their butter chicken / poutine pizzas though.\n\nCoffee with Jessica. I get along so well with her it's surprising we're not better friends. Probably because of the strain from hackathons. From the mind map and from talking to her, I now know what needs to be done in my situation. I do have my own set of values / goals, they just happen to be pretty aligned with hers, so it's not a huge problem that I'm self-improving according to that. I'm worry a lot and the fear of not finding someone keeps making me turn to the current options, even though that option is not right for me. She's a great friend to have - lots of fun to hang out with, always down for exciting new things, but she definitely doesn't fit my criterion for dating, I've just been in denial. Why do I strive so hard to fit hers? It should be a give and take where we both do that. Why wouldn't she stay by my side and help me grow? And all the ways I can think of that if I improved may attract her are shallow, so would I really want to date her if thats what it took to get her to like me?\n\nWe talked for over 2 hours, it was really great, then I went to the SE Hack Day event where I worked on porting my website to jekyll. A sudden, massive thunderstorm erupted and though it only lasted like 10 minutes, it seemed everything in its wake was completely wrecked. Trees were knocked down, RCH got flooded, power went out. Our school buildings are not sealed very well at all.\n\nWent to badminton afterwards and ended up playing mostly level 3s. Definitely not nearly at that level yet. The games always ended with scores +/- 1 apart, but I felt like they were all going easy on me, or I had a good partner. He definitely had to cover for me many times and it was clear my shots did not sound the same as theirs. My footwork very much limited my ability to hit multiple shots in a row.\n\nVeronica was in town so Jamie was feeling shitty, and all the bars' power was out still so we went to my place to drink. We watched Hang Loose and played a game where every time something reminded us of the Hawaii trip or one of us cringed, we'd drink. There was so much cringe in the movie, we ended up downing most of the bottle in that hour. After that we started watching Mystery Team and drank every time Jamie wtf-ed. I had roughly 8 shots in that hour and a half and that definitely did not work well for me.

I got approached a couple times by girls asking to dance, but didn't actually dance with them before they seemed to have gotten bored and went to dance with someone else (Maybe I took too long to make a move? Or my dance moves are crappy?), the one time actually danced with a girl I tried to go further too quickly and she excused herself. Later saw her making out with a different guy.

Very satisfied with how much reading I've gotten to do these days.\n\nFirst part of hike was closed due to rock slides so we started hike from Corniglia. At the beginning we weren't sure how to get to the trail so we asked some people for directions. They were headed to the same trail so we followed/befriended them.

Quite expensive but definitely much needed / best lemonade I've ever had. Just the right amount of thirst that I needed, perfectly sweetened and cold. The man said he'd visited Canada before 35 years ago for a 4 week vacation. He'd even been to Kitchener/Waterloo. No idea why you'd wanna go there for vacation, such a long one at that.\n\nAfter successfully making it to Monterosso, we grabbed some drinks by the beach, then went for a swim. The water was too cold for me so I didn't swim long. Sat by the beach and did some more reading / napping. Some chick straight up took off her swim suit in the middle of the beach, flaunting upper body nakedness to the public. Guess that's not an issue in Italy\n\nWe took the train back to Riomaggiore and ate at another generic Italian restaurant. They advertised free wifi, but I had to ask twice before she gave us the password. She'd respond \"si\" looking annoyed, then do nothing. She handwrote the password and we couldn't really decipher her writing, so we just gave up. Didn't need wifi that badly anyways. When I got served my food - pork cutlet with salad - I asked for vinagrette. She said \"no\" and some other things in Italian that I didn't understand, then walked away again doing nothing. I guess they didn't have vinagrette? They had balsamic vinegar though, so I don't quite understand what happened. Quite terrible wait service.\n\nAfter dinner we scrambled to find where we had meet the hostel shuttle. The directions given to us were very vague. At the meeting point we met Lucy and Hatty. They were also headed to the hostel. Turned out they were also headed to Venice the morning after and were also staying at Generator. The drive to the hostel was crazy. Not as scary as Kris' driving, but often during turns we'd be in both directions of traffic's lanes. People would stand in the middle of the road and expect cars to avoid them, not giving a fuck. At one point we reached a one-car lane that apparently served two directions of traffic. A car from the opposing direction sat in the middle of the lane and the driver conversed with some people standing outside the car.

Lots of ash for 2.\n\nRepeated tradition of miracle berries and infinity hug. Forgot to get a group photo!!\n\nSome people left and the rest of us cleaned the place, then headed home.

Going to reskin and add draggable\n\n\n\n\n", 1397534400=>"Moved to the new floor. It looks absolutely gorgeous and there's a new cafeteria with a permanent panini press and pizza oven. When I walked towards our new desk area, there was a set of conference rooms in the way and our desks were on the other side. I saw Dan sitting there and excited walked straight ahead. The glass was really clean and I mistook it for having a door and ran straight into the glass.\n\nDuring lunch went to the bank to figure out the card blocking situation. Apparently they thought I was in NC this whole time and when I made a transaction in Santa Cruz, they thought it was suspicious and flagged it. 2 months of transactions in SF didn't mean anything, but somehow crossing the line into Santa Cruz was too far. The account manager that helped me was like oo you work at Twitter? I've been debating getting Twitter stock and you coming here is a sign, I'm going to do it!\n\nAfter work was the Dropbox intern event. This one was much better now that I knew enough people to have circles to talk to. Holly mentioned that she had read my blog and shared the overpaid syndrome post with her friend. Totally caught me by surprise and got me ecstatic. People actually read and share my stuff! Crazy! When I went back to re-read overpaid syndrome, it's quite cringy. But I probably won't edit it, to preserve the history of how I've gotten better at writing over time.\n\n\n\n\n", 1398657600=>"When I woke up I felt like crap from the previous night. Pat and Zach took a while in coming to get me for windsurfing though, and by the time they came I had sobered up quite a bit.\n\nWe went to Berkeley and picked up Tommy then headed to the waters. The winds were especially strong and I broke a sail by leaving it on the dock, which I totally wasn't supposed to do. I thought everyone would get mad at me, but everyone in the community were so nice about it and just helped me fix it. No reprimanding or anything. It seems fixing a sail just involves first sanitizing it with alcohol, then taping it up with special sail tape. The sail tape is also made of the same material, so it kind of acts like an extension / patch.\n\nAfter fixing the sail I grabbed a second one and headed back in the water. This time I did a lot better and actually got up and went with the wind a bit. Definitely feel improvement from the previous time. I wanted to keep going, but the sun had started setting and Pat and Tommy were tired already, so we called it a day.\n\nGot some food at Sea breeze down the street. Decent sandwiches. Then said goodbyes to Pat and Zach. It has been a fun semester with them. At Tommy's I helped him get measurements for a suit he was buying for upcoming weddings. Did not realize there were so many different measurements involved in suiting.\n\nAfterwards, Tommy said he'd take me for a ride on the motor cycle, and then decided it'd be even better to teach me how to drive it. He took me to a parking lot and showed me the basics. Not dragging my foot, shifting gears, braking, etc. At one point I dropped the bike and it didn't start again and I felt really bad. Thought I had broken it. But it ended up being alright. By the time it got dark I was able to go around the parking lot on second gear and switch down to first to turn the corners. Still nowhere near street-ready, but I did sort of ride it legitly. Bikes are so much fun since it feels like you're part of the environment as you drive, as opposed to being inside a metal box and observing from afar. I'd probably still end up getting a car though just because of convenience of being able to take others, etc. On the bike ride back Tommy got a bit of extra speed in and it felt really good. A bit homo pressing against Tommy, hair blowing in the breeze, but I can totally see how a girl riding in the back could swoon for a guy.\n\n\n\n\n", 1397707200=>"Got randomly pinged during work by Dan for a \"very important meeting\". Turned out we were making milk tea out of kitchen ingredients. I tried to do some funky combinations like adding in hot chocolate powder and nutella, but they all tasted bad.\n\nEscape from the Time Travel Lab after work. On the way there got into some silly hypothetical discussions. Like what if in the future we got TVs to do our baby sitting. We could have facial recognition software decide when someone approaches the door whether to let them in or not, etc. The Time Travel Lab was pretty cool. The puzzles themselves weren't particularly special. All original in that they weren't instantly solvable from previous experience, but nothing that blew my mind. The use of time travel was cool though. Once you figured out the puzzle, you had to follow that instruction to \"travel back 24 hours\", wherein you enter another room that looks the exact same except with slight modifications. You had to do stuff in the past to influence the future - order a book, water a plant, buy a screwdriver\n\nAfterwards ate dinner at Suzu Ramen. Not up to par, but wasn't terrible. Was going to go back to work to play poker, but instead went home and played smash bros. Collins taught me the basic stuff like teching, L cancel, and shield grab. But if I don't think about them, I don't really do them still. Also I should roll less and do more of just dashing around. Sheik and Link are both great at doing up A and air hits. A good combo is to down grab, then up A. With jigglypuff you can throw a falco/fox up, then jump and rest for insta-kill when they're at low percentages. A lot of more advanced play is predicting where opponents will go based on what they usually do and knowing what is out of reach for the opponent but within reach for you. When they do an attack that is too slow, you punish them by getting in hits, and then use finishers when they're at high percentages. There's no need to be using every move a character has. In fact some moves are terrible and should expressly be avoided.\n\n\n\n\n", 1377835200=>"On train ride to the Vatican some kids attempted to pickpocket me. One asked me for the time, despite the fact I didn't have a watch or anything. I thought that was quite strange so I said I didn't know. As I looked down, I noticed the other person beside me reaching into my pants pocket. Thankfully my pants are pretty tight so they weren't successful.\n\nOn the walk to the Vatican people tried selling us tours, telling us how we'd skip the lines. We disregarded them, but saw that lines were ridiculously long so ended up getting one of the tours. He originally said the cost was 41, but since we expressed disinterest he said if we came back it'd just be 35. After talking to other people, some other groups got it for 30. Gotta learn to haggle better. Tour turned out to be just as bad as we expected. Definitely don't want to do any more o those. Did not at all care about the vatican museum part of the tour and the Sistine Chapel was completely packed with people. You couldn't take pics and had to be silent, which they ironically reminded you over the loudspeaker of every couple minutes. Not at all how I'd enjoy it. St Peter's Basilica was slightly better. We did the 500 some steps climb to the dome at the top and got a nice panoramic view of Rome.\n\nGot crepes while walking back to train station. They were massive and I got some weird sauce I had never tasted before. Tasted good at the time it left me uncomfortably full and with a strange after taste.\n\nTrain to Florence super nice. Good wifi, read almost all of the 40 days experiment\n\nChecked in at Plus Hostel - clean, spacious, great amenities. Wifi was crazy bad though\n\nQuick jog around Florence as soon as we got there\n\nDinner at Pool Bar - chicken thigh super dry, worst possible salad for me\n\nInternet Cafe to research what to do in florence, Maddie bumped into us, told us how their plan is exactly like ours but one day ahead. French girl living in Spain, told us to avoid Gibraltar, but go to ___ in Spain and France. Our roommates were two people from Turkey who didn't want to really talk to us, and Sallo (sp) from Brazil. Did not know that Portuguese was Brazil's official language. Rest of South America it's Spanish. He works for the Brazilian Navy and was in the UK teaching them how to use some of the naval force's equipment. He said people in Brazil are not happy about how much money is being spent on the World Cup, since money is needed in health care and other more important facets.\n\nBought some weird snacks and drinks - 66cl beer was 90 cents, and is definitely one of the better beers I've had. Strange orange soda with Naruto on it. No relevance at all to Naruto.\n\nPlayed EuroTrip drinking game - whenever Cooper calls his boss, says something related to \"parking car\", goes to new country, new hot girl appears on screen.

Hang glided there - weather was kinda dreary but it seemed fine for what we were doing. Hang gliding was not what I expected at all. Though the glider is probably 50 pounds or more, with the wind blowing it pretty much weighs nothing. When you're hanging, you don't use your arms at all. I kept trying to pull to turn, but you're supposed to use your hips - lean your hips towards the pole Shakira style as the instructor explained. And when you try to turn, the turning isn't immediate, there's a delay before it starts happening. Because we had so many people, and for some reason they didn't use all the gliders, we each only got a tiny bit of air time. Most of the time was spent chatting, which was still pretty good times.\n\nLunch at Koi Palace - not bad dim sum. We put the go pro on the table and spun it around. Got footage of Jon sticking a whole egg tart in his mouth / Romain's reaction when eating chicken feet.\n\nWent back to work and fixed the bug! Also Jamie taught me some vim. Still have a hard time just using it when I want to be productive, but I'll get there.\n\n\n\nDNA Lounge - got rejected 3 times again. Twice were straight rejections: \"hah. no.\" \"sorry, we're leaving soon\". Once I was girlfriended.

Nicole and Preksha happened to be at Williams also so I sat with them as I thought about how I could join the club. Was too scared to do so. Eventually manned up and asked to sit with them. Was completely overwhelmed at first by the people speaking French. I literally just sat there paralyzed, I had no idea what to say to them at all and I couldn't understand what they were talking about. Pretty sure that's what it'll feel like when I first go to France. I tried saying some things here and there, but it was very shoddy French and conversation didn't go anywhere. I sat there thinking of how I could leave but could not even remember the French words for excusing myself. Soon another guy sat down next to me and he introduced himself as Florian. He mentioned that he was from Lyon and I told him that's where I was going next term. It turned out he's from INSA Lyon and he's doing an internship at the accelerator right now. Crazy coincidence. He's also in Informatique. He said that courses are pretty easy, drinks are cheap. He gave me his French/Canadian number so I can contact him at either of those places.\n\nAfter the meeting ended and I was walking to the lab, I again felt the happiness I did at Electric Forest, where my face was stuck in a smile and there was practically an orgasm of pleasure/happiness exploding from within me.

Really dumb move. \n\n\n\nDan showed me a game called Nertz. Each team gets a deck of cards with a different back on them. Each team can be 1 to however many people. The teams play solitaire with 4 spaces, flipping over 3 cards at a time. When a space frees up, any card can replace it. Doesn't have to be K. You throw cards in the middle starting with A and the piles are communal. Anyone can add to them. Also everyone has a \"fan\", which is 13 cards spread out. You can only take cards from either end of the fan. You use the fan as you would the 3 cards you flip at a time, either in your solitaire build or throwing in the middle. The game ends when one person runs out of their fan. Each other team gets -2 points for each card left in the fan and everyone gets 1 point for each card with their back in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n", 1364529600=>"tennis in morning. lessons helped a bit but still really bad at predicting where ball will land.\n\npeople came to our office for open house - keanu, jennelle, yanish, kartik, jonathan, alex, etc. general games and such. jon has a pebble which is pretty sick. he says it's not as great as advertised - battery lasts a day and a half, and is only useful in situations like biking. otherwise notifications are annoying.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nbalaclava is the black mask thing you wear over your entire face for skiing and such\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118 crazy awesome article on vim.

Zipcar is very convenient. Comes with fasttrak + credit card for gas + car is very feature loaded (though it was so fancy that we had a hard time figuring out how to open the hood, took like 30 min). Basically blasted Taylor Swift the whole way there. Sandy and Mark are big fans. Apparently one part of I Knew You Were Trouble sounds like a goat Took a group lesson for snowboarding at Kirkwood. Group lessons are not great since not that much focused attention, but did learn that I should lean more weight on front leg when I do turns / squat down more to use knees.\n\nSandy learned super fast and was almost able to keep pace with us after just one day. Did a bunch of blues and was able to almost carve on some of them. \n\nAte dinner at Capisce!, an italian restaurant. Delicious focaccia and spicy pasta, albeit quite pricey. Good conversation with the group about tech stuff, like how 3D printing and google glass are basically the future. But this means there'll be so many issues with DRM, privacy, piracy, etc. These guys are def wayyy more knowledgeable than me.\n\nGot some beers and chilled at lodge (Aston). Very spacious place - 2 floors (2 beds, 1 couch, kitchen, bathroom). Tried making up drinking games like throwing beer caps into cups. Ended up playing Fizz Buzz (who knew it was actually a drinking game), and then created own adaptions like Fizz Bizz Buzz - hilarity ensued.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nJava sucks because of checked exceptions, type erasure, building is hard, common patterns like factories are way over-engineered and verbose\n\nSHA1 no longer secure enough, too easy to crack.

Assets should not be served with them since there is no caching / hard to debug.\n\nNoSQL is not actually proven to be faster / more scalable or anything. There's just more redundancy so that it's faster to do reads at the cost of more space usage.

He was incommunicado for half an hour for I assume pretty obvious reasons and then we got going. Mark had the setlist on a playlist on his phone so we basically just played that the whole way there, as well as other Swift songs. Found out about \"Thug Story\". Pretty much the best song ever.\n\nWe got to Toronto and ate at some Korean place in Chinatown, I don't know how to pronounce the name. Met Ryan's friend Spencer and Sandy's friends Helen, Kang, Leena. All very cool people.\n\nGrabbed bubble tea on the way to the Rogers Center, where Ryan and Jon bumped into someone from their high school or something. \n\n\n\nRogers Center for TAYLOR SWIFT!!! There were so many little 16 year olds, we all felt really young. The person we got to take a picture for us commented it was weird how we were such a large group of dudes, they didn't understand how we got convinced to go to this.\n\n\n\nAt first we were pretty sad about the seats we got, the main stage was so far away. But when the show got going it wasn't so bad. \n\nEd Sheeran was amazing. He seemed very genuine, his music was good, and he used a looper pedal thing to add layers to all his music himself. Didn't have any backup performers.\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift came on and was super sassy. She looked off to the side / upwards, in a way that reminded me of Colleen. Other than that she wasn't that similar to Colleen though. She talked down to the crowd like we were toddlers or something, and everything she said felt really scripted. Ironic when she commented before \"Mean\" about how there will always be people who pick on you, but you just have to learn not to pick on other people yourself. I connected with the bit she said before \"All Too Well\" about how emotions are hard to express and understand, and she writes songs to try to understand what she's feeling at the time. Seems like a good approach to get over things. \n\n\n\nOther than that the performance was awesome. Knew pretty well all the songs and had a blast singing to them. In between her surprisingly fast costume changes, there were mini-ballet performances, dubstep violin, and other crazy stuff like that. She did an interesting dubstep mix of \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". Before 22 she came over to the side stage which was literally just meters in front of us, so our view went from shitty to epicly good. Still didn't get to touch her hand, and felt jealous when we saw on the screen all the people that did get to do it, but she was super close and it felt really real. Way more real than other concerts I've been to. She had fireworks and sparklers going on for \"Sparks Fly\" / \"We are never ever getting back together\", which right at the end made the fire alarm go off. \n\n\n\nMark looked really unhappy the entire concert, had his arms crossed and wasn't singing along or anything. He said afterwards he was just super intensely concentrating on how awesome the concert was. There were some dudes sitting near us who were clearly there because of their girlfriends and they looked extremely bored/unhappy the whole concert. Don't understand how they could spend $130 to do that to themselves. \n\n\n\nAfterwards got some swag - a bag and an unofficial shirt from an outside vendor (was 1/4 the price of the real deal). We were thinking how merchandise selling is a huge pain point that could be improved and streamlined better.\n\n\n\nWent to Karaoke at Echo in Chinatown. Was quite a blast as usual.\n\nDrove back to Waterloo and talked about our girl situations / what motivates us in life. Mark wants to become a better engineer and in general just focuses hard on things to improve himself. Sandy says he doesn't really have any passions and just does things to try to find what his passion is. \n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nBack to December's about Taylor Lautner and how Swift screwed up in that relationship by not treating Lautner right\n\nStay Stay Stay isn't about a real person, just what Taylor wishes she had in a relationship\n\nCool game Jason told me about: to start the game one person writes a noun on a paper. Another person without looking at the noun completes the sentence <noun> _____. From then on the game starts. The next person tries to draw what that full sentence depicts. The person after that writes down what they think the picture is, and the cycle continues.\n\n\n\n\n", 1375156800=>"Did my last psych experiment.

Crazy expensive. Lesson learned, will try to book a bus next timeIt rained the whole time we were there. Walked to Notre Dame, Hotel de ville, then strayed from the path we were supposed to go. It was extremely cold and rainy, Jamie was in a bad mood, so we stopped for hot chocolate. The place was at the northwestern end of Paris. Paris is surprisingly big. There was a massive gathering of black people, we weren't sure what was happening. There was one white guy amongst them. He may have been on drugs. He took off his shirt and was waving his arms around. At one point his thing was hanging out of his pants.\n\nKept walking and eventually passed the Obelisk and ended at the Champs Elysee. Hot chocolate there was 9 euro so we stopped by McCafe for hot choolate. Craziest one I've ever seen. Two floors, completely packed. There were self-order machines and they had a legit espresso maker. They sold macaroons and other things I didn't think McDonalds would have.\n\nAfter warming up a bit, went back out into the rain. Saw the Arc d'triomphe, then headed to the Eiffel Tower.\n\nSome people walked by with bazooka looking things. They pointed them at us and shot roses out at us.\n\n\n\nThe Eiffel Tower at one point sparkled, but by the time we tried to capture it on video, it stopped and never did it again. After many calls, finally managed to meet up with Uncle Zheng\n\nHe took us to dinner at a Chinese place. The food was from XinJiang, which has some Arabic influence. The noodles were fantastic, very elastic. Would definitely go back again. \n\n\n\nWe stopped by the opera house on the way back to their place very briefly. Linda told us about how the man who designed Paris wanted everything to be uniform. That's why most buildings look the same.

Chris, Phil, and Sam came though\n\nRock climbing intern event. Got certified to belay again, but didn't really use it since I bouldered the whole time. Did most of the V0s, though there's a couple I couldn't. It was actually mostly the skin on my fingers hurting that prevent me from continuing. My forearms felt alright. Dan, Michelle, Sam, Chris, and a bunch of other Stripe people came. They're actually located a block away so they come regularly. Did a bit of bench. First time in forever. Did 5x1 with 45, then 2x1 with 55. Never gone that high before. Interested to see what my set would be now.\n\nHeaded back to the office for dinner. Ate with both Dans, Justin Wyne, and Jennifer and Andy. They were playing with an app called Povio that's like the opposite of snapchat. You ping someone to take a pic of what they're up to and it happens. Was really stupid since only the people at our table then used it, so we just had a bunch of pics of that. Could be an interesting app but could also be really annoying since you have to ping someone else to see what they're up to. Don't want to be that annoying friend. We got to discussing how pain prevents you from doing stupid stuff to hurt yourself and I mentioned that heartbreak doesn't really make sense in that case. Sotolongo said it's a byproduct that happens because your brain becomes wired differently after you become dependent on another person, that when they're suddenly gone it hurts to rewire back. He says he knows from experience and has thought a lot about it. Left me speechless.\n\nSmash bros with Dan and two other coworkers. They're pretty good, but don't think they're at Collins' level. We mostly played 4 player, so it was a lot of derping with random characters. Not serious playing.\n\nWatched some Day9 at work. That dude is absolutely hilarious and such a good story teller. Must learn from him.\n\nBy the time I left work it was 1:00AM. Walking through the tenderloin I noticed some cops flashing lights huddled by the wall. I figured it was another arrest, noting this would be the fourth I've seen in 3 months. Getting closer I notice the person on the floor isn't moving. Hah, must be really drunk or something. I get even closer and I notice a police with yellow tape. Strange. By the time I walk directly in front, I notice that the body is covered in blood and the cops are trying to pick it up. Chills run down my spine. No TV show's gore has prepared me for this. I quickly keep on walking and notice fire trucks and more police cars pulling in. Never walking through the Tenderloin in the dark again.\n\n\n\n\n", 1404792000=>"Smash with Jason while we waited to get picked up. Went to All Stars with Xuehai, Jason, Henry, and Xuehai's friend. Henry is pretty much living the life. His startup UMention got to a million swipes a day, but he didn't feel like the app aligned with his interests anymore, so he's quitting the team. He's going to be working at Google after this term. He did an exchange in Hong Kong and traveled tons around southeast Asia, then ended the term by traveling through India, Middle East, and Europe to get back. In India street vendors sel stuff next to bathrooms. One time, a vendor liked his shoes and offered to trade food for them. Apparently Indians are super welcoming of Asians. Lots of people took photos with him and paid for some of his meals, etc. When he visited Egypt there were barely any tourists at the pyramids due to the portrayal of all the bombings.

Not what I expected at all - basically each podcast tells 3 stories of a certain theme. It's a cool way of sharing common people's stories. One of the podcasts sparked a good conversation about what we did when we were young, which transitioned into how we've changed.\n\nAt Finch looked around Loblaw's. Found a bunch of exotic fruits and got a bit of each - dragonfruit, mangosteen, granadilla, and a couple others I don't remember the names of. Also got a couple cooked olives, which I still didn't like the taste of.\n\nRox went to her acupuncture thing and I went to a park to study psych. When she finished we ate lunch at a tofu shop. They home make their tofu, it's pretty good, definitely one of the better places I've ate at in Toronto.\n\nJon met us there. When we were standing outside trying to figure out plans for the day, I dropped Rox's volleyball on the street and it got run over by a car. Pretty stupid of me. We decided to go downtown to meet Kimmy.\n\nMet up with Kimmy and Jon gave us a tour of U of T's campus. Their campus is slightly better than Waterloo's but I wouldn't say by much. They do have a cool building with a pink staircase, and one with a giant orb-like structure hanging from the ceiling that apparently has classes in them. The building where we attended the graffiti party (everyone wear white shirts, draw on each other's shirts with markers) in two years ago is the equivalent of our CPH.\n\nGot Kimmy some Timmy's then ate that and the exotic fruits we got earlier. I liked dragonfruit the best, Rox liked granadilla. Kimmy's allergic to most fruits so she didn't try them. She thought timbits were okay. Jon asked what we'd want to be reincarnated as - pretty good conversation starter. Used it again throughout the night when new people joined our group. He did a photoshoot of Rox posing as more and more ridiculous things - started out with normal model stuff \"show me sexy\", etc. Then went into giraffe, praying mantis, chair, and other such. Rox did them all pretty well.\n\nPlayed Forbidden Island and Tsuro at Castle - a Snakes and Lattes clone without as many games / charges per hour. Neither were all that fun. Out of nowhere during the game Rox asked if any of us ever randomly wanted to kiss people. Pretty lulz. Jon said he sometimes wants to bite people, and proceeded to bite Rox at unsuspecting moments throughout the night\n\nXuehai joined us and we ate dinner at Kensington Bistro - french restaurant in Kensington market (very cool district, definitely want to go again. lots of other good food to try there). Very very fresh and delicious. Jon knew the chef there. Their brussel sprouts were not bitter at all and the chicken / bourginon were all fantastic. Jon told us about his current co-op at BCG doing management consulting. He said it's a bit like House of Lies, but not completely. The job sounds very much like what we used to do in Future Problem Solving club. Totally forgot about that.\n\nHeaded to the theater for Despicable Me 2. Definitely worth seeing in 3D. 3D is no longer super gimmicky, it's used to add layers to the film which is great.\n\nStopped by ChaTime - not bad bubble tea shop, then went to some Japanese bar by Jon's place. There we met a bunch of Jon / other people's friends - Ashton, Wacy, Ronald, and more. Ashton went to elementary school with Rox. They're close friends, used to live pretty much in the same neighborhood. Ashton said there was some weirdness in their history involving guys, but everything's okay now. Ashton was Miss Chinese Toronto or something like that and she's super tank at drinking. Kimmy had to go half way through so I dropped her off at her hotel. Her dad knew right away that we were drinking. I went back to join the group. There was lots of singing together and learning the cup rhythm thing. We went to Wacy's place to jam some more. Xuehai and Ashton duetted on guitars, we played some Never Have I Ever, Ronald got super mad and was throwing his phone around because of his ex-girlfriend or something, not completely clear.\n\nAt 4am we ended the night and I wanted to go back to Waterloo so I could study the next day so we did that. I drove Xuehai's car and dropped off Rox, then went home. That was a super selfish move on my part. I jeopardized both their lives by wanting to go back - driving at late night + rain when not having a license and having not driven in a year is super stupid. Thankfully nothing bad happened. Should not do again though.\n\n\n\n\n", 1399089600=>"Woke up pretty late. By the time I got to work it was pretty much time for the send off meeting where they took away our laptops.\n\nI had a quick lunch with the team, said our goodbyes, then headed to the Caltrain to palo alto.\n\n\n\nInterview at Nest went pretty well. During the interview I realized the mistake I had made at the Dropbox one with the min heap. My last interview was a bit iffy though, so I don't know if I got the job. Nest seems like an interesting company. Definitely would consider working for them. Cool low level protocols made just for the \"internet of things\". Everyone seems quite old though. Not like the Stripe or Twitter crowd.\n\n\n\nWent down to Mountain View and had dinner with Ryan at Chef Zhao Bistro. Pretty decent szechuan food. Ate way too much and was uncomfortably full. Talked about having a party where you practice opening bottle in cool way, then drink all the beer. Change passwords every two months so you learn new vocab in another language or something useful, we're both no longer excited about free swag / food anymore. Means we are too veteran now\n\nWent back up to SF and did karaoke with Dan, Ben, Brian, Amber, Christina, Chris, Sam, James, Victor. Got pretty drunk and just got all around silly. Good times, lots of rapping.\n\n\n\n\n", 1404964800=>"Played some smash with Jason, Kyle, Xuehai while we waited for the others to show up.

I got into the office around 11 and had the presentation course until 4, so didn't really do any work the whole day. The presentation workshop was really cool. They recorded us giving a speech, then had us watch it, then taught us some tips and then redid the speech. When I'm giving a speech my eyes dart around and I rock on my feet, and my arms get stuck in one pose doing the same motions there. I should stand firm, vary my arm motions, and focus my eye contact on one person per segment of the speech. Every time there's a pause I should try to make eye contact with someone new, and don't dart around in between. Silence feels a lot longer when I'm up there but it sounds normal to the audience. I don't have to fill every gap with \"so...\".\n\nAfter work we hit up beer hall and chilled there and played a board game. The board game sucked - it involved memorizing numbers, but it had a set of cards with interesting questions so instead of playing the actual game we just went through those instead. Some good conversation starters / learned interesting facts about the other interns.\n\nVisited square around 7. Their office is super pretty and clean. The food is way too healthy, pretty much all sprouts and other crap like that that I couldn't eat.\n\nWent home and did laundry and played some smash with Collins and Ryan. Had an intense duel with Daniel. We're about the same level. When I went to get my laundry, it turns out I screwed up by putting the new red pants with the new white ones and my white ones became pink.

We were really drunk, talked to some random french people on the side of the road, then decided it'd be a good idea to bike home. I couldn't rent a bike since my card didn't work so we shared a bike.

Also he got a credit for a course when he was doing an exchange in Korea despite not showing up for class ever, just because the university didn't want a bad rep. Apparently he needs to watch tv while coding, it's the equivalent of people listening to music. He pretty much knows about every show ever. He's very cynical yet super social/energetic at the same time, strange combination.

Got a group photo that was super hectic to organize given there were like 40 people there.\n\nWe got $15 of games with the meal and then after a certain time we had unlimited play on the non-ticket games. Played the basketball game we have at twitter but somehow only got 6 points on it, despite getting 60s at twitter. Some other fun ones were this one where you try to tap as money of the lit up buttons as you can, deal or no deal, mario kart. Wacy won the jackpot from the light spinning in a circle thing. We aggregated everyone's tickets together and ended up with 12k tickets. The biggest prize was a teddy bear that was 13k. We scrambled trying to figure out how to get the last 1k to get the teddy bear, considered asking strangers for tickets. Somehow carmen ended up having another card with 2k tickets on it, so we got 14k tickets. Upon second look, the teddy bear was actually kind of ugly, so we were debating which of the giant stuffed animals to get. Decided to let ash just pick herself what she wanted. She ended up going with a toaster oven and steamer, so practical. We were all shocked. We decided it was actually the guys that wanted the giant stuffed animals. Makes us feel manly to get them.\n\nThroughout the night the number of people began to dwindle. We stood around til the very end and were the last to leave.\n\nWent back to crash at Rox's place, the 4 of us squeezed into Rox's bed. We laid there stalking random people on FB, rating who had hotter friends until 4am or so", 1367467200=>"Last full day in Hawaii so we tried to take full advantage of it. Started day nice and early with car rental and getting stuff together\n\n\n\nGot to Kahe Point Beach Park by 9ish. My phone experienced the strangest error along the way - temperature too high, can't charge. Guess it's not meant for Hawaiians. Jason's driving is interesting - he stays pretty much consistently 10 miles under the speed limit.\n\n\n\nThe waves were quite killer at the beach; seemed like a salty wave pool. The first giant wave broke my snorkel in half, not that it mattered since it was easier to look at the fish without it. Fish were sparse and the waves made it hard to venture out so most of the time we just played in the waves. We spotted a couple sea turtles! Jason touched one even. Definitely made the snorkelling feel much more legit. Yelp reviews kept mentioning packs of fish being at \"the pipe\" and we heard from some of the scuba divers the same sentiment, yet none of us really knew what that meant. I tried venturing out farther, but it only got deeper and colder, didn't see any more fish than at the shore so I went back\n\n\n\nAfter a sufficient amount of wave-fun we headed to lunch. We went to a nearby Hawaiian BBQ joint. I asked for their most hawaiian dish and ended up disliking pretty much everything from it. I liked the pot roast-like pork and that was pretty much it. Their pulled pork does not at all compare to North Carolina pulled pork and there was a seaweed-wrapped beef concoction that I could not at all stomach. It probably wasn't Hawaiian BBQ that was bad, but the joint itself. The others didn't really like their foods either.\n\n\n\nWe drove to the hiking trail, which like the previous one started in a neighborhood. It was questionable whether we'd be able to do it. Jason had a stomachache and Nicole had salt water in her ear so seemed like bad times were being had. They both decided to tough it out. The hike didn't have as many epic views as the other one, but that wasn't what we were looking for. It did meet the expectations of rainforest + waterfall. The path winded down with exposed tree roots creating interesting footing. It then transitioned into rainforest canopy - not all that it was made out to be. Rainforest canopy came with mosquitos and humidity. We saw some strawberry guavas along the way but it wasn't in season so they weren't yet edible. There were bird sounds like you hear in any movie about rainforest, yet we didn't really see any birds.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the hike we encountered a small waterfall. A group had gotten there just a bit before us so we had to wait our turn for jumping off the waterfall. This actually worked out as we unexpectedly had fish nibble at our feet while we waited by the water. We played with the fish, feeding them chicken crackers, and got some pretty cool footage out of it. I also caught a glimpse of a cray fish. Finally the other group left and we got some jumping in. Definitely not as scary as compared to bungie, etc, given the meager height of the waterfall, but still a good adrenaline rush when hitting the water. Very worth the hike. My gopro ran out of battery unfortunately. I ended with not that cool of footage from the jumping. Hopefully Stephanes is better for that.\n\n\n\nThe hike back was definitely harder since it was pretty much entirely uphill. I feel bad for Jason, he was getting dizzy and clearly extremely tired. Two hikes in three days is quite a bit. We did manage to get back safely.\n\n\n\nHad dinner with Khallil and Kris again at Yardhouse. I couldn't order beer because apparently my OHIP card was expired… by 4 months. No idea how I had gotten any alcohol at all the previous couple months. Ordered steak and shrimp. Very mediocre compared to the jumbalaya from last time. Khallil told us the story of how his parents are so rich - \"they basically own a bunch of small things\". Apparently they started selling counterfeit parking stickers and that got so big they had to buy their own printers. Then with those printers they went on to make windshield cooling pads. since students didn't want to pay for them, they got companies to pay for them and printed their logos on them as advertising. They continued with a bunch of other series of small businesses and now they own a hotel, a chain of cafes, a sushi bar, and a bunch of other random things\n\n\n\nEnded the night with a bottle of expensive wine at our hotel Stephane had brought. We chilled on the balcony, sipped on wine, and chatted. Good conversation starter: \"if your life flashed before your eyes, what would be 10 memories you'd see?\". Kam's were pretty hilarious: the time he ran away from home for a couple hours, one time he was playing smash bros with some friends. Somehow we ended up talking about flirtation and Stephane and Nicole were confused on how people could do that stuff - there are clearly going to be consequences and people ending up hurt. Jamie gave the analogy of doing drugs. \n\n\n\n\n", 1400212800=>"Made plans to have lunch with Vicky, but also bumped into Rox, Xuehai and their FYDP group. Funny exchange between Rox and Vicky - Rox asked if Vicky still hung out with Jack (she thought they broke up) and Vicky was like yeah..? We're still dating. Rox was leaning over / on Xuehai during this conversation. Vicky says I assume you guys are still dating too? Xuehai and Rox are both like lol... no... and Vicky wasn't sure if it was a troll or what.\n\n\n\nSPCOM did an impromptu on \"how to entertain family/friends\". Prof was surprised I didn't do it chronologically and instead informed about entertaining familiar vs unfamiliar friends. Had some jokes about entertaining grandma. Prof said I would have gotten an A if it were graded\n\n\n\nTwitter Dinner - invited Holly, Andrew, Jack. They all said they had a lot of fun, which is good to hear but I was a bit surprised about. Glad it worked out.\n\n\n\nPoker night - Sean V got super competitive and angry over people playing incorrectly. I came out tripling my winnings, but that was still less than one buy in at Twitter. And it wasn't as fun since people weren't as jokey / good. Taking candy from a baby as the saying goes. One play that significantly boosted my earnings was a showdown I had with Andrew. He didn't know how to play at all and kept calling my raises and when we revealed, he had nothing. He thought he had a flush because he thought spades and hearts were the same suit.\n\n\n\n\n", 1354424400=>"Angel Hack\n\n\n\nGangster Burger\n\nSaw Scott / Ian, Loo people\n\n\n\n\n", 1345780800=>"Chilled with Ethan, had grilled cheese at The American.

They have one of those crappy coffee brewers and that's it as far as coffee goes. Eric and Collins got Bulgogi Omelette and I got a Kimchi omelette. They were massively huge and really delicious. After lunch I went to chill at LaFayette park. There's tennis courts there! Spent pretty much the entire day backfilling ohlifes. Really let that pile up, was almost a month's worth to do. In between them I'd take breaks to practice the shoulder freeze and do some bridge poses. Really nice day at the park.\n\nChris Wu came and joined me in the afternoon and we got dinner at Tai Chi restaurant, then headed to Twitter. We talked about tech, about girls, and weddings. Chris made me realize that doing crap work is good. You don't want to work at a company where crap work is piled on the lowest people. Everyone should do their fair share of it. And you have to do crap work to abstract it so other people don't have to do it.\n\n\n\nAt Twitter we played a round of Mario Party. Lost to the AI but still was quite fun. Been so long since I've played that game. Dan met us at the office right about when we finished the game. We watched Dr. Horrible and played the drinking game. New rules for future viewings: drink when there's a transition to a song, when there's punching.\n\n\n\nHighly enjoyed the movie as usual, then played some guitar afterwards. I want to learn at least one song before the end of the term. Stretch goal is two songs on guitar and one on piano.\n\nMy ride home the uber didn't end her meter until way after I got home so had to complain. Don't usually like doing that, but this was not cool.\n\n\n\n\n", 1379822400=>"Bus ride home from the beach. Groceries. Made ratatouille, beans, steak.

I goofed hard while researching. But good thing we didn't already reach San Diego at least.\n\nInstead we went to Santa Monica. Everyone was so in shape there, and really fratty. I guess if the weather was that gorgeous I'd have more incentive to get in shape as well. I embarrassed myself quite badly trying to climb the rope\n\n\n\nGot cronuts from some shop along the way back. They weren't fresh but still tasted as amazing as I had hoped.\n\nStalked Ryan Gosling's address online, then drove down to that area to check out all the celebrity's mansions. They were all crazy massive. The craziest ones you couldn't even see since they were gated. Didn't bump into any celebrities unfortunately\n\n\n\nDrove back towards Griffith to hike the hollywood sign. We took the wrong route and drove up a crazy windy mountain path with space for one car but two way traffic. So many near death experiences on it. Got my adrenaline pumping quite a bit.\n\n\n\nBy the time we got to the hike the sun was already setting. Still a short fun hike though\n\nMet up with Ryan and them as well as Valerie for dinner. Best ramen I've ever had - Daiko Kuya. So simple yet so amazing.\n\n\n\nConversation wasn't awkward but it wasn't particularly stimulating either.

Sean was way too hungover. We ate a viet buffet once we got to Bourg St Maurice. Or rather I ate and sean drank water. He had to pay the price for the buffet though. Most expensive glass of water ever.\n\nWe got to the hotel, rented equipment, then just chilled the rest of the night reading\n\n\n\n\n", 1378440000=>"There was only one laundry machine at the hostel and it was in use so we went looking for alternatives. We discovered a place called the Laundromat Cafe which let you do laundry while you chilled. Laundry was obscenely expensive just like everything else in Copenhagen but there was free wifi so we got some work done. I did a mind map of why I care so much about karma / want everyone we meet to like me / care so much about being invited to things and it all boils down to the fact that I need external validation for my socializing / want to be the center of attention, which may boil down to my only child syndrome. Still haven't really figured out how to get rid of my need for external validation. \n\nWe rented bikes from the hostel and went around the city. The bikes lanes are quite wonderful - they're usually either raised or separated by parked cars / trees. We went to the landmark labeled Little Mermaid. All it was was a boring statue, yet it was surrounded by tourists taking photos with it. Apparently the author of the Little Mermaid was from Copenhagen and that's why it's a big deal. The Little Mermaid supposedly is quite a dark story also. I guess that's how most of the books Disney movies are based on are. We stopped by the Design Museum but it was closing just as we got there. This seems to happen quite a bit. We biked around some fort also, but don't really know the historical significance of that.\n\nWent back to the hostel and joined the free dinner. Sat with Jade and her friend Kat. Kat explained the different parts of the UK to us in the best way ever. Look at the UK as a Witch riding a pig. Cambridge is on the butt of the pig, Wales is the foot, London's in the middle of the pig, etc etc. Jade apparently was at the top of her class for forensic science, she loves the jigsaw puzzle that is a murder mystery. She's totally cool with / excited by dead people. She has also traveled quite a bit and highly recommends we check out Vietnam in the next 5 years before it becomes like Thailand. It's quite unfortunate that there's a positive feedback loop for tourism. A place is interesting so tourists swarm there, then they try to capitalize on the tourism and it no longer is interesting to the people who wanted to see it as it was originally.\n\nAfter dinner we went to the happy hour. Iona and them were back. They did a walking tour of Copenhagen and went to the aquarium. Interesting facts they learned: lots of fires start in Copenhagen. The town hall itself was burnt down / rebuilt 5 times. One fire was started by a candle being knocked over in a house and it burned down half the city. The parents blamed it on the kids.\n\nStarfish have eyes on the ends of its tentacles and its mouth comes out of the middle of its stomach when it eats.\n\nThe rest of the night we just hung out in the common area of the hostel and talked. Apparently in Britain pickup lines are called chatup lines, snow pants are ski trousers, and frosh week is fresher week.\n\nIona told us the story about how she got a carpet burn from making out with a bearded guy and it ended up scabbing and looking quite funny. She asked what were some of our embarassing stories and Jamie shared the one about us trying to pick up the girls from DNA lounge.\n\nSome guy hit on one of them with a chatup line and he started by saying \"I pooed my pants\", paused for way too long then said \"Can I get in yours?\". Another guy once tried \"Wanna see the swan show?\" then did the gun show thing except with his hands being swan's heads, then sang while flapping his hands. \n\nWe played the umbrella game and green glass doors game with them. Funny as always.\n\n\n\n\n", 1387688400=>"Took the train to Munich. Had some problems with the eurail pass (Eurail Episode blog post). Walk around city. Leech free wifi from the university.

Was a bit awkward at the mother scene because of Stephane's situation, but it was great to rewatch. \n\n\n\nDinner with Lily, Eric, Stephane, Nicole at Baker St Station in Guelph. Good beer selection, really good food. Highly enjoyed the waffle with ribs, foie gras butter, nutella inside. Also best onion rings I've ever had. You actually taste the onion, yet it's super crunchy.\n\n\n\nWatched the Perseids at some random off road on our drive back. Saw about 3! There was also strange flashes, which we assumed to be super distant lightning. There were mosquitos and we still had to study, so we went back shortly after.\n\n\n\n\n", 1400472000=>"Sean's family was over this weekend and we dog-sat for them a bit. Their dog Dexter is quite cute. Made me realize I can't get a dog since I'd be distracted by it / want to play with it all the time. Went for a run with the dog. At first it sprinted like crazy and was hard for me to keep up. Then it kept stopping at poles to smell / lick them / pee on them. I guess he was marking them or something, but don't know how he had so much pee in him. At one point he saw a squirrel and dragged me hard as he tried to chase it. Turns out the squirrel thing is real.\n\nRead through the rest of 400A then took a nap\n\nDinner with Sean's family at itamae - interesting how they talk about neurotransmitters and other deep things like that, instead of just talk about my friends like I do with my family. In Chinese and Japanese don't have a word really for \"no\". You have to quantify \"no ___\"\n\nSkype with parents - they stalked Rui hardcore, was telling me how she has 4.0 GPA and is on the dean's list\n\nTalked with Sean about what if we didn't have desires, how we overcame certain desires like video games when we were younger, why did parents have me try so many different things when I was young? Was it for me to find happiness?\n\n\n\n\n", 1349064000=>"Watched the strangest documentary today in which a guy looked at the world's largest insects, and for each one he'd conduct an experiment on himself to demonstrate the prowess of the bugs.

Perhaps climb into the cabin of the train parked in Waterloo Park. Unfortunately she had a birthday party to go to that night so it was a maybe for whether the date would go down.\n\n\n\nDinner with Cindy at N & N in uptown. There's way too many places uptown I still haven't been to - Crazy Canuck, Taco Farm, Beer Town. The food was really good (but also really expensive). Had foie gras for the first time. Had two different types - the first one was foie gras baked into a pastry and that was delicious. I guess the foie gras basically melted and it made the pastry really oily and delicious. The flavor was great. The other one was legit foie gras. It was just a chunk that looked like butter. It tasted a bit like stinky tofu, except super rich in flavor. Was too strong for me to stand, so Cindy ate the rest of it. Pretty fun times - talked a lot about food. Apparently she's a fourth year in mechanical engineering. Did not expect that. She also has a hunting license and plays baseball.\n\nAfter the date, I wasn't sure what to do so I just waved goodbye. It seemed like the wrong thing to do, but I had no idea what is the right thing. So I consulted Ash. She said waving basically means it was okay, maybe see you around. I should read body language and tone to see if they reciprocate interest and if they do, go for a hug or kiss. If I'm not sure, I should go for it anyways.

Still as good as the previous day.\n\nWalked through the city enjoying the sights. We saw stickers on the floor for something called \"Relegation\", so we followed them to see where that led. It ended up taking us to a dead end with a poster on it. Nothing special at all. The dead end had a harbor to the Grand Canal, we sat there and drank our wine, basking in the sunlight. One of the bottles tasted surprisingly good while the other was completely terrible. Ended up taking a short nap right there.\n\n\n\nWent back into the city. Matt needed an adapter and we needed to find postage stamps. Strolled through half the city, hitting up 5 Tabacchi shops before we finally found one that had international stamps.\n\nMatt told us about a cool bookshop so we looked for that. Outside was a sign that said \"the most beautiful bookstore in the world\" and I don't disagree. It looked like something out of Harry Potter from the outside. Inside there were books cluttered everywhere, not sure how it actually functioned as a bookstore. In the middle was a gondola full of books. There's no way you'd know what books were at the bottom of it. In the back was a staircase of books. Cool view.\n\n\n\nNext on our journey was to find the sandwich shop Chris Wu told us about. Unfortunately we got there right as it was closing. Ate instead at some generic pizzeria. Nothing special. We got Spritz since Chris also mentioned that and we saw advertisements everywhere for it. It looked and smelled great, but it tasted like cough medicine. Would not drink again. That in combination with all the wine we day-drank gave me a headache.\n\n\n\nWhen we got back we were in no mood to drink outside with the others again so we just packed our stuff then crashed.\n\n\n\n\n", 1400299200=>"Woke up early to do the graphics assignment.

Pat and Zach weren't ready yet so it took us a while before we got out the door. We ended up deciding on Big Basin for hiking and camping since you can just walk in without reservations and then more mountain biking tomorrow. The hike ended up being quite mild, following all the other hikes that we've done. There were some crazy big trees, but not that steep of a climb and not much of a view aside from the astounding trees. The hike lead to a waterfall. Or rather a little spout. A group of asians huddled nearby taking photos. We helped them take some photos then went off the route and tried climbing the waterfall. Measuring the water with a stick, it seemed to be hardly deeper than our heights, so probably not safe to jump into. The water looked quite murky as well so it didn't help our desires.\n\nAfter the hike we set up camp. Instead of taking our designated spot, we found one down the hill a bit, in the middle of the raw nature with crazy trees all around us. A picture perfect scene. We explored some more while the sun still shown and ate some PB&J sandwiches. We engineered a spreading knife out of a Solo cup.\n\nWith the sun gone and the rain pouring the entire day, we were starting to get cold, so we set about making a fire. We bought two batches of firewood and two fire starters so it should have been extremely simple, yet we couldn't get the fire started despite using both fire starters and having burned through all our paper boxes - the wheat thins box, beer box, etc. As a last resort we gathered some kindling from the forest, looking under trees where it was slightly less damp. The kindling did the trick. Guess the fire wasn't hot enough to sustain without kindling. Armed some rainbow fire salt, we had tons of fun with the roaring fire. Fire's one of those things you can never get tired of looking at. It's ordered chaos and is constant entertainment. When we stood close, our pants would visibly steam from the fire's heat. Pointing our flashlights up into the sky you could see single drops of rain as they fell through the rays of the light. I've never been so entertained by the rain before. It actually looked incredible, following the drops with your eyes. We talked about how it's crazy we've gone from relying on fires to iPhones in a couple thousand years, and how we didn't even have the internet 30 years ago. We reminisced about newgrounds, ultimate showdown, the matrix videos, end of the world, and other old videos and games that we used to play. Back when flash was still a thing.\n\nThe forest was really big on being crumb clean because of an endangered species of birds that inhabited the area. Who knew feeding birds is actually hazardous to them, since it makes them dependent on humans and introduces predators to environments they shouldn't exist in. We joked whenever we had any food droppings about being crumb clean. And we also burned many things we shouldn't have as part of the running gag. Definitely a cancerous weekend. We burned several plastic containers and a glass bottle. The glass bottle melted into a blob, kind of like what'd happen in poorly done glass blowing I assume. We stuck some rainbow fire salt in the glass and it shattered and crumbled from the heat when we threw it in the fire, and lit up all sorts of pretty colors.\n\nBy about 11, we called it a night and headed to the tent. This must have been what life was like before smart phones. Funny that I love hiking so much now yet I didn't enjoy it when my parents took me hiking when I was young\n\n\n\n\n", 1392008400=>"Crepes in the morning with the Hyde interns.

But magically met up with Jamie pretty easily despite neither of us being able to contact each other.\n\n\n\nMassive thunderstorm when we arrived. Thought it'd be a shit show, but after we came out of the termini after lunch, the sky was cleared up. Lunch was meh terminal food. Nothing special.\n\nRome has the worst street signs ever. They're carved onto the sides of buildings, which is great aesthetically, but I have no idea how people drive cars at night since you wouldn't be able to read the signs, and half the time they're only carved on one building in one corner.\n\n\n\nWe managed to find the hostel thanks to the awesome offline maps app. Our roommates at the hostel were four girls from some school we'd never heard of in California - Maddie, Torrey, Natalie, Mandi. They're doing an exchange in London and were traveling beforehand, on roughly the same timeline as us. They recommended we check out the fountain nearby so that's what we did.\n\n\n\nAlong the way we did two geocaches. The first one was in the mouth of a wolf statue, the second one was underneath some pavement. The one in the wolf's mouth was a gladiator figurine that started out elsewhere and was meant to be taken traveling by people who found it. The final destination was Rome. The description said it was racing a different figurine, so I guess that one won, unless the other one was elsewhere in Rome. We checked out a massive church near the fountain and came up with a couple silly photo series ideas. We're going to try our best to avoid generic tourist pictures. We've gotten some good shots for them already, will post when they're done. It's astounding how monolithic all the buildings are, and that they were built by people without the tools we have today. I say that proves giants were once in existence.\n\n\n\nWe thought about putting a geocache in the fountain, but decided it was too early in the trip to be getting arrested. We definitely want to put one somewhere crazy at a later time though.\n\nGot back to the hostel and the roomies also just got back from whatever they were doing, so we decided to get dinner together. Ate at a restaurant nearby - most of our food wasn't anything spectacular. The only thing I thought was special was the lasagna Torrey got. It looked and tasted completely different from a lasagna you'd get elsewhere. The biggest difference was how vinegary and cheesy it tasted. Our waiter was a massive troll. Apparently you don't tip in Italy, and yet all servers are still super nice. Also places get offended when you ask for water. You have to pay extra for water.\n\n\n\nThe girls told us about a game they've been playing called \"What are the odds\". How it works is you propose a challenge to someone saying \"what are the odds that you do _____...\", and they respond \"one out of X\", where X is a number they feel comfortable with. Then you count down and simultaneously say a number within the range of 1-X. If you say the same number, the person has to do the thing. Some that happened from their previous night were \"lick the floor\" and \"walk home shirtless\". Some that we had in our night were \"chug a shot of vinegar\", \"lick a handful of salt\", \"pose by the fountain prom-style\". Some potentially hilarious ones that didn't end up happening were \"offer to take a photo for a couple, but take a selfie instead\", \"sit down at another group's table and join in their conversation\", \"go to a historic landmark, then ask someone right outside it where that landmark is\".\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we went to a gelato place they particularly liked by Trevi Fountain, which was on our list of places to visit. The gelato was indeed extremely rich, but I still wasn't blown away. I'd previously been hyped by people who visited Italy that gelato there is so great you wouldn't be able to have gelato anywhere else afterwards. I didn't find that to be the case. Then again, I have terrible taste buds.\n\n\n\nWe debated the merit of having yourself in pics of scenic spots. I didn't understand why you'd want to be in every picture; you're not doing anything special in most of them, wouldn't friends just want to see the interesting places you're at instead? The others said if you weren't in it, you'd simply be competing with professional photographer's shots of the scenes, but not doing as good of a job.\n\n\n\nAfter hanging out by the fountain for a bit we went looking for a bar. It's surprising how many places are called \"Bar\" in Rome (might be a chain?) or have it in its name, but aren't actually bars. We ended up finding one in an alley. It had Birra (beer) in its name, seemed legit. As we headed in, there was another big group that went in at the same time. It was a bachelor party. The lucky guy's name was Roberto, he had a bib with his name on it and everything. None of the wait staff in the pub spoke any English. This is exactly what we wanted - a completely local bar. The beer we got, Perino, was very light but had a nice wheaty taste. We also got shots of this thing called limoncello that's apparently a specialty in Italy. It was tasty, but very strong. Maddie tried buying a shot for the bachelor, but it was difficult communicating what we wanted with the wait staff. He ended up bringing the shot to us, so I think he thought we demanded the bachelor buy us a shot instead or something. After we got that sorted out and Roberto took the shot, his friends asked the four girls to all give Roberto a kiss. Pretty funny/creepy given he was like 10 years older than them. The bill ended up being only 25 euros. Super cheap compared to drinking in North America.\n\n\n\nWe tried finding our way back to the hostel and bumped into some fellow Americans. They said they were from Alaska and without prompting, talked about their disdain for Sarah Palin. The guys' names were Stro and Joe. Joe had moved to London about a year ago and was getting married to an Irish girl. They said the coliseum was very close by and beautifully lit at night so we went to check it out.\n\n\n\nAt the coliseum we met two very good looking French biker dudes. They had biked for 10 days to get from Paris to Rome. We spoke a bit in French.\n\nMandi really had to pee so we went looking for some place that was open. We stumbled upon the night life of Rome - there was a crowd of young people gathered around a popping night club that turned out to be a gay bar. \n\n\n\nAfter the short bathroom break we called it a night and headed back to the hostel. Maddie told us about a cool social experiment on the internet called 40 days of dating and we talked about the 5 languages of love.\n\n\n\nAll in all, a great start to our trip. Jamie thinks we've peaked, but I think there will be other nights as epic as this. Definitely won't be every night, but there has to be more.\n\n\n\n\n", 1379649600=>"Shopping in Lyon.

They mix whatever that liqueur is with Fanta, then shake it before serving it to you. They even have special gloves for shaking. We went back to our place and played some King's Cup.

We were pretty organized with teaching them the cheers then getting them to Meet the Dean and Virtual Tour. After that however it started raining, for the first Frosh Week in 7+ years. Everything went downhill from there, but Edcom and FOC did a pretty good job of salvaging the situation. Most of the events were moved indoors, which resulted in a lot of crowding and disorganization. The skit event was pretty cool though - we had to put on a skit based on another team's theme - Peter Pan. The audience made sound effects while Ryan narrated and the selected Frosh put on the play. Ryan did a fantastic job and so did the Frosh who played Peter Pan. They reacted well when provoked by Edcom and kept it hilarious. Near the end Edcom told Ryan that it was boring and he should make it more interesting. So the alligator came on stage and mauled everyone. Edcom yelled \"SAFETY FIRST\" and Ryan reacted by saying the alligator transformed into a fish. Edcom reacted \"NOT SAFE ENOUGH\" and Ryan narrated \"the fish transformed into a butterfly\". Generally lulz. After all the Earn your Hardhat events wrapped up, Frosh went to Single and Sexy while we went to take a break and eat food. At the debriefing, because of all the chaos half the leaders hadn't arrived, so Headcom read us some Dr. Seuss in Edcom voice. Pretty damn hilarious. \n\n\n\n\n", 1383451200=>"{tasks}\n\n- Bus to Barcelona [sl,3]\n\n\n\n- Read persuasion [re,1]\n\n- Spanish omelette [tr,1]\n\n- Read persuasion [re,1]\n\n\n\n- Nap [sl,3]\n\n- Tapas tour [tr,2]\n\n- YouTube [na,2]\n\n\n\n- Nap [sl,2]\n\n- Opium [so,4] ~ big Martin, jake, till, Carla, dani, julien, mark\n\n\n\n{deets}\n\n- Confirmed.

Ate at Jasmine Garden then grocery shopped and headed out. Car ride there was pretty boring - we only had Vincent's music which consisted pretty much entirely of Drake, which none of us liked. Not much talking occurred.\n\nWe passed by Oakdale which apparently was having a cowboy festival. There were white people in cowboy hats everywhere and american flags all along the side of the road. We at first couldn't tell if it was a festival or if the town was just super white.\n\nWhen we arrived in Yosemite, kept missing the side stopping points where you could get pictures of good scenery. We kept saying \"Ohhh!!\" as we approached one of them, but Vincent thought we were freaking out about cars approaching and kept missing the scenic points still.\n\nWhen we finally arrived in Curry Village, no one else arrived yet. We got our tents then just happened to bump into Naveen's group. After some freaking out about not being able to find the other two cars, we magically bumped into them also. From there we headed to the campgrounds where we could actually start a fire since we weren't allowed to in Curry Village. The trek was only a mile, but organizing everyone together proved difficult. Kris got glowsticks for everyone and that helped a lot. He's good at thinking of things like that (though in this case can't tell if he got them for partying or if for finding each other). \n\nOnce we got to the campground, it turned out to be flooded. So we got the drivers to drive back to Curry Village to pick up all the cars so we could head to the other campground. In the meantime we played Mafia, which turned out to be the worst game of Mafia ever. No strategy was involved, people were just killing random people. There was no discussion of why people were killing each other off, there was just voting. The drivers came to pick us up basically just at the time when both the inspector and doctor had been killed off. \n\nWhen all 6 cars pulled up in the parking lot, it felt kinda like a moment from Transformers. We rolled out in our large convoy and eventually the lead car realized we were going the wrong way. We had to do a massive chain U-turn and at this point the park ranger pulled us over. 1 park ranger. Pulled over all 26 of us. Guess a trip can't be successful if we don't get pulled over at least once. No one got ticketed though, he thought we were trying to show him up or something because we honked our horns, but when we told him we were lost, he pointed us in the right direction. After that Kris was leading the way and he started weaving from lane to lane. At first we thought he was confused and was switching lanes to get to the right lane, but then realized he was just trolling. Pretty cool seeing the weaving formation of cars.\n\nOnce we got to the campground, finally things started going. People started making fires, others started making sandwiches. Things were piecing together. We got successful barbecuing going - marshmallows, hot dogs, zucchinis, potatoes. We got sandwich, snack, and drink making going on also. People looked like they were having a good time. The park ranger came by to check on us and even though we were drinking and stuff, he was totally chill. It's good to be doing this stuff legally. We went to a nearby bridge and laid down and watched the stars. We actually saw a shooting star! My first one ever. It looked like a plane was crashing for a sec, pretty crazy big and bright. We stopped stargazing when Patrick said he thought he saw large eyes at the other side of the bridge. Freaked me out much more than it did everyone else.\n\n\n\nFollowing stargazing we played some puzzle games. The first one was \"what can fit under the umbrella?\". You ask \"can X fit under the umbrella?\" and the gamemaster tells you yes or no, and you have to figure out what can fit. \"An umbrella always fits under the umbrella\" -> the trick is you have to say \"um\" when you ask if something can fit. Halfway through the game I got pulled over to help Donald. He was drunker than I've ever seen anyone, quite dangerously so. Patrick and I helped him use the washroom. Patrick handled it much better than I. He kept talking to Donald to keep him awake and gave him water, etc. Apparently other puzzle games that I missed included \"pink elephant\" and \"sculpture\". Will have to learn in the future how those work.\n\n\n\nAfter we cleaned up, we headed back to our tents and crashed for the night, finally.

They were all very smart and we worked well together.

Also there may be missed opportunities in Cali. To Jamie the long distance would allow us to see what it's like and would allow us to decide after the 8 months whether to keep dating. To Xuehai long distance would not be worth it since I'd be missing out on freedom.

Got a ride from Jennifer in the morning. She offhandedly mentioned that she forgot where Michael was from since it was \"filler conversation\". Interesting that she'd consider talk about people's backgrounds to be like that. The offsite was at a park in San Mateo. We got food catered to us - there was quiche and stuff, pretty unusual for the bbq grill. Played some frisbee and chilled.\n\n\n\nPeople started leaving around 3pm. A couple of us decided we wanted to get ramen since there was good ramen in San Mateo, but nothing was open until 5:30, so we went to get bubble tea first at Tpump.\n\nJennifer discovered Threes and was completely obsessed with it the whole way. The rest of us played some spades. Tpump was actually quite delicious bubble tea. The crowd were all high schoolers. A group of them got a selfie at the front. Could not get any more stereotypical\n\n\n\nAround 5:30 we pull up to the ramen place - ramen dojo - and it's closed. We go to the other place across from the street and it's also closed. We drive to a different ramen shop a mile down and it's also closed. There's no holiday or anything though, for some reason all the ramen shops in San Mateo have conspired to close at once. Ended up eating at a mediocre ramen shop in South San Fran\n\n\n\n\n", 1371960000=>"Sushi with Jack, Vicky, Nicole, Stephane, Jason, Rox\n\nWatched Orphan Black all day - pretty damn good showWatched Jiro's at night at velocity\n\n\n\n\n", 1375502400=>"Lunch with Christina at Itamae - talked about our interests, what we want to do, happiness, her love life situation, our timelines.

Those kids are hilarious to karaoke with\n\n\n\n\n", 1376107200=>"Went to Velocity to help Rox wrap the gifts for Xuehai\n\nDrinks at Molly Bloom with Andrew, Ewelina, Joel, Xuehai, Rox. Toasted Midnight Sun's car finally working and of course Xuehai's birthday. Gave Xuehai the gifts.\n\n\n\nAt night we decided we couldn't just end Xuehai's birthday like that. Not nearly memorably enough. We had to do something more special. So we decided to go to Niagara Falls. Couldn't really convince anyone else in Waterloo to go, but Jon got a bunch of people from Toronto to be down.\n\n\n\nFrom Waterloo it ended up being just me, Jamie, Xuehai, Rox. From Toronto it was Jon, Freddy, Wacy, Justin, Bianca, Eva. And later Ashton came with Carmen, Jen, Tiffany.\n\nSince Waterloo got there first, we just got beaver tails and waited around. Rox and Xuehai went on the ferris wheel. When Toronto came we went to Wendy's and talked about going to the haunted house, to which Jamie and the girls all vehemently opposed. Everything was closed by that point and we couldn't even get drinks for Xuehai. Jon had a bottle of rum though and we just drank that, split between all of us. We walked along the waterfall til Ash's crew joined us. Then we decided to try to go down to the bottom of the falls. We hopped a fence and walked down the path. I went ahead to scout it out and it turned out there was a security guard waiting in the middle of the road waiting for us. We all dashed back as fast as we could. We then just chilled by the falls some more and watched the sun rise.\n\n\n\n\n", 1389502800=>"Sean arrived in the morning. Since we didn't have enough time to actually explore Lyon, we just played some magic at my place\n\nTook the train to Brussels and played magic the whole way. The heroes deck is clearly better than the monsters deck.\n\n\n\nChecked in at the hostel. We noticed our roommate wasn't there, but his/her stuff was there. We joked around pretending to be sherlock holmes and conjectured about who the roommate was based on their stuff. We ended up deciding it was a decently sporty caucasian guy (ended up being correct).\n\n\n\nStarving, we left to eat at the indonesian place next door. First time having indonesian food. Pretty similar to other asian cuisines - noodles with carrots, cabbage, onion, egg. Also had some sort of crunchy thing though that tasted fantastic.\n\n\n\nWe walked around, got some belgian fries and waffles. Belgian waffles aren't actually a thing. There are two types of waffles: liege waffles are circular and have sugar inside, Brussels waffles are rectangular with sugar on top. \n\n\n\nStopped by aux vieux bon temps to get westvleteren. I didn't really enjoy it that much. Very strong beer. I can see how people can rate it as the best though - very complex flavor. My palette just isn't sophisticated enough to understand it.\n\n\n\nWe walked around some more, getting kebabs, more waffles and fries.\n\nWent back to the hostel and hit the bar. Tried so many different beers and played some foosball. They played the belgian beauty pageant on the big screen because apparently one of the people working there's sister in law was in the pageant.\n\n\n\nA guy from Brazil studying in Norway joined us at the bar for a bit. He left to sleep and we met Jenna and Marianne. Jenna's from Maritius, lived in France/England, and now has been in Brussels for a year. She's studying to be a lawyer. Marianne's from Brazil and doing an exchange in France. She only spoke French while Jenna was fluently bilingual, so we had some interesting conversations that involved both languages \n\n\n\nJenna told us a story about how she had a class in France with 500 some people and during the very short break, over half the people rushed outside to take a smoke break\n\n\n\n\n", 1396065600=>"Daryl lunch came to visit for lunch with his little brother. Sounds like he's really over worked. Apparently Srikanth (frank 2) didn't get fired as id expected. He figured appdynamics wasn't working out so he applied to some finance places since he liked reading Econ stuff in his free time. In his interview with Merrill lynch he mentioned that he liked reading Econ in his free time and they asked him some Econ questions. They were impressed with that. Apparently he knew stuff even senior people didn't in interviews. They told him they didn't want him for the SE job but instead wanted him for the assistant VP of the 401k division. Kind of a big deal. Maybe he just didn't have an interest in SE and that explained his incompetence.\n\nAfter work was march madness themed happy hour. They held a slam dunk competition and we convinced desiye to enter since dick did also. Dick didn't even end up doing it but desiye got some hilarious dunks in. For one he had Tristan throw it against the wall, then he jumped over Tristan and dunked. He ended up getting third place, which won him a tshirt\n\nWe grabbed food at SO. No cupcakes still, but food was just as good as always. We went back to the office and played board games. First we tried resistance, but the group was so passive we never had any discussions. All decisions were just done through votes. One round Kyle was a spy but he wasn't paying attention and voted success at a crucial moment and they lost. Another one the two spies were revealed on the first round so it seemed like we got them. Then it turned out Tristan was trolling. Worst game ever with that bunch. Hilarious though.\n\nWe tried taboo and that worked slightly better. Some lulzy results.\n\n\n\n\n", 1366516800=>"Morning grabbed breakfast at Casa something something, the Mexican place across from Safeway. It was very mediocre. Totally forgot there was good Chinese food at Golden Gate Park.Went to Golden Gate Park with the sf crew and chilled near Academy of Science - played some frisbee, tried to do kick ups and stuff.\n\n\n\nWent with Yanish to check out Hippie Hill. Supposedly everyone was gathering there for 4/20. Indeed when we got there, it was completely crazy. I would say there were at least several tens of thousands of people there. All smoking pot, selling pot-related food/accessories. Felt a bit second hand high from just being there.\n\n\n\nXuehai picked us up from there and we joined the others at Camp Lotus. Dinner was still being served thankfully. It was surprisingly delicious - steak, pasta, sangria, chicken, garlic bread. Despite it being camping, the food was actually better than what I normally eat.\n\n\n\nWe played some Ultimate Frisbee in the camp. Yanish basically single-handedly won for our team. Paulom did a pretty crazy jump to grab the frisbee at one point and flipped over a bush. Looked seriously dangerous. \n\n\n\nWe found candles nearby (found out the next day it was for some sort of memorial or something) and lit one for each of us and sat in a circle, talking about what we were thankful and such.\n\nWalked back to our campsite, lit a fire and chilled around it. Got cool footage of firemaking. Played Umbrella and Pink Elephants. \n\n\n\nZach, one of the rafting guides, joined us at the fire. He taught us Hot Shlaka - if you cradle a hold your fingers like a cage and drop a hot coal in it and shake really fast, the coal won't actually burn you. So you basically do the cradling, then pass it along. \n\n\n\nWe ended the night soon after and set up our sleeping situation. A couple of us decided to sleep outside. There weren't many stars, but I'd never done it before and only in Cali is the weather nice enough yet not humid enough that there'd be mosquitos. It actually felt really nice to sleep outside. Legit bonding with nature and the sun actually wakes you up when you're supposed to. Obviously it wasn't great for my back but still I felt epicly well rested\n\n\n\n\n", 1377057600=>"Alex came over and we had Bojangles. It was the first time in over a year for both of us. Even though we were full after we had our order, we shared another 4 piece. By far the best chain of fried chicken. We played some ping pong afterwards to work off the fat, while talking about life. He's on track to work at Wall Street, which I found out encompasses pretty much everything finance-related, not just stock trading. New York is fun in terms of night life, but aside from bar hopping and clubbing there's not much else to do. Columbia has a culture of hookups, quite starkly different from Waterloo. He explained that shorting happens in the secondary market, which doesn't actually affect the companies. The only people affected by it are the people trading in the secondary market. Supposedly the value of shorting is if a company does bad as you predict, you'll get more money to then put into the primary market to fund companies. We talked about how ridiculous some snobby rich people are, how VR/AR are screwing over our generation, and lavish hedge fund parties. At the christmas party for his work all the first years/interns were given 40 oz steaks to eat/race. It was really good steak too, but you couldn't take the time to savor it.\n\n\n\nChristina messaged me around midnight and we ended up talking on the phone while both strolling outside. It was a full moon. She told me about her guy problems and we talked about how as we grow older and we see more, we become more accepting of things. Our innocence gets corrupted, which isn't necessarily bad. We judge things for ourselves once we've seen their existence. I think a huge part of what allows me to relate to others is that I've seen so much TV. I've seen people's problems and how they get dealt with, so I'm accepting of similar problems when people have them in real life.\n\n\n\n\n", 1367553600=>"Returned car, finished cleaning and packing, then left the hotel\n\nGrabbed some shave ice / crepes from the crepe house. They unfortunately didn't have pineapple flavor and I also didn't manage to get a pina colada before we left, but the shave ice was still pretty good. Eating shave ice brought up the memory of when I got sno cones with Kirsten and we watched the sunset as we talked about our future. It's quite strange the things that cause nostalgia to happen. Jason said that a lot of smells remind him of his ex.\n\nWe grabbed a limo to the airport (through a service Khallil told us about) which actually was cheaper than getting a taxi. He agreed to spin by the fountain for us to get a pic\n\nAt the airport watched Forgetting Sarah Marshall since it was about Hawaii. We definitely did not get the whole hut on the beach experience shown in the movie, but oh well, we had quite an epic vacation nonetheless. Very good movie, totally forgot the plot - had it confused with I Love You Man. Mila Kunis is so hot / awesome.\n\n\n\nOn the flight back to Oakland played some Scrabble / attempted a crossword / drew random things in the magazine with Jamie. Jamie's pretty good at Scrabble, twas reminiscent of the days of AP Physics where we actually had to strategize on how to avoid giving the big points to the other person. In terms of doodles we tried copying what we saw in the magazine, used fonts we saw in the magazine to write new words, etc\n\n\n\nLanded and had a hard time finding Kris' car. He took a picture of roughly the parking spot, but funnily he didn't manage to capture any of the section signs. Riding in his car was pretty strange given we had just gotten used to Jason's below-speed-limit driving.\n\n\n\nArrived at Kartik's and went to Lori's for a midnight meal. American syrup doesn't really do pancakes justice. Maple syrup is way better.\n\n\n\n\n", 1405656000=>"Gave speech on studying abroad - how it makes the easy things hard and the hard things easy. Went really well, definitely much better than the previous two. Still have to work on body language, swaying, vocal / facial variety.\n\nFixed invisible cows bug in raytracer after tackling it for 5 days. It was all because I had a normalize in my ray instantiation. Thought I was being clever and minimizing normalizations, but I did the ray instantiation in other places I didn't realize and that was screwing everything up\n\nMorty's with Xuehai and Rox. Talked about dating. Xuehai has a very different concept of dating from me and Rox. To him it has to end in a long term relationship. He doesn't believe in dating just to get to know someone better.\n\n\n\n\n", 1399435200=>"Before class gave my room a reorganization. I can now see the floors woot Tuesday and Thursday are my busy days of class. Enjoyed all of the ones I've had so far. Zoology is really cool - I knew things were made of cells but never thought about how the more complex the organism, the more specialized the cells are. The simple organisms' cells do everything, whereas the complex ones have cells that pass information to other ones for them to do their own role. It's a good metaphor for large companies. I may use it in my next piece\n\nPublic Speaking we had to give a 1 minute impromptu speech on the person next to us. I interviewed Laura - she's really into camping and once saw a snowmobiler fall through the ice / people try to save him before he caught hypothermia. But of course when I went up to give the speech, I completely butchered it. When I saw the timer I freaked out and my speech was full of \"ums\". Converting bullet points to actual sentences is hard. Definitely being witty and concise on the spot is my greatest weakness in speaking. From the prof's feedback, my smile, gestures, and expressions were good though.\n\nLunch with Eric. He's driving down to Cali tomorrow. Seems like he's doing really well\n\nAfter the fourth year design project lecture met up with Naveen and Jason and brainstormed some more ideas. The ones we talked about all got me really excited. Send a recipe to an app, it makes a burrito for you. Hook up a glove to a VR device and simulate the feelings of touch when things happen in VR. Have multiple people be able to duel in VR wielding real life objects\n\nSean took me to buy some climbing shoes. Really expensive, but if we do go often it should be worth it.\n\nWent for a short run. I'm awful at keeping pace when I run by myself since I know I can push harder.\n\nAlgo course was also super exciting. Fell asleep for a bit since PHY 145 is just not conducive to learning, but the course itself is great. Algorithms we learn will be based on things like bird migration patterns, and harmonic sound waves. Pretty much everyone I know is in that class - Collins + Eric, Ethan + Desiye + Sarah, and then some ECE people\n\nWent for drinks after the class with Stephane and Nicole to catch up. Stephane got quite into formula one the past term. Funny story about Jamie being a loud sexer. Jason described it as \"when you hear something unusual, you really focus in on that sound\". I shared the rome bachelor story, ellie goulding stories, and me being bad at reading girl-signals in paris story. I consulted them on girl issues and they were much more helpful. I should ask at some point when I'm over it just to get her impression of the situation. Definitely shouldn't ask now.\n\n\n\n\n", 1390798800=>"worked on TEDxUW websitewatched spring breakers - terrible movie, wasn't worth finishing. lots of gratuitous boobage though. and kinda makes me wish i could do a trip like that - cruising on mopeds at night with friends, doing silly things and laughing our asses off, dancing with hot girls all day. but then again, don't really wanna be involved with all the drugs, and electric forest pretty much had the dancing all day, i just didn't do any of the sexual things related to it\n\n\n\nwatched toy story in french - could understand most of what they said\n\n\n\n\n", 1347163200=>"Another day of dicking around and doing nothing.

Got to try crocodile and kangaroo for the first time. Crocodile tastes a bit like fish, and kangaroo is pretty tough. Not a fan of either.

The Book of Kells wasn't all that interesting, the Long Room, an archaic double floored library, had books from the 600s. Crazy architecture too.\n\nDelicious irish food - I asked the server what the most irish dish was, she recommended something, then told us the chef told her it wasn't very irish and gave a different recommendation. Ended up having irish stew (steak, potatoes, other veggies) inside a pastry. Quite delicious. Jamie tried to get me to savor the food. Smelling it, chewing it slower. It really tasted great\n\n\n\nBray cliff walk - cool view off the cliffs. We went off the path a bit, got some nice scenery from higher up. When reached the end got ice cream and talked about what our ideal kitchen would be like. I'd want it to be sleek stainless steel appliances, black marble everything. The stove should face away from the dining table. I want the food to magically appear, don't want people to watch the cooking process. While we hiked we discussed what makes someone relaxed confident vs cocky confident. Cocky confident people are always trying to prove something. Relaxed confident people know they're pro, they've got nothing to prove. They just meet new people because they're cool and genuinely listen to people they meet instead of looking for opportunities to brag some more. They actually care what other people say.\n\nWent with Jamie to Generator for him to check in. Along the way saw a street library - a graffiti of a bookshelf that people were supposed to draw in the name of the books on. Very large variety of what people have written in for books. Also saw a life size bop it game. Generator is as nice as the one in Venice. Watched rugby in the main social area. Given I don't know the rules the game looks completely nuts.\n\n\n\nWe went to the Temple Bar area to check out the comedy show. Turns out we got the wrong day so it wasn't showing. We went to a different place that had comedy instead. This one wasn't rated at the top of tripadvisor but we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. The jokes and execution were all painfully bad. It wasn't even just us that thought it was bad. No one in the crowd really laughed.\n\n\n\nCouldn't stand it so we left to catch the bus. For some reason the bus didn't stop at the stop so we tried to chase it down. Thankfully I bookmarked another stop so we went to that one and the next (last) bus actually stopped there.

Learned to do several spins, though I didn't quite master the hand transfers / ani-obiwan spin. Also got to practice some hitting choreo but that was relatively simple. None of the crazy stuff. The teacher was super chill, and I did not expect the crowd at all. Thought it'd be super geeks but that was not the case.\n\nLunch at Indian Garden. The Tenderloin is mad sketch.\n\nWatched the entirety of game of thrones season 2.

Since we got up mega early, we ordered Timmy's for breakfast. Conversation in the car: \n\n- child development as a service - help parents raise their kids correctly. -Cool app idea would be if you could somehow do IDs and passports through phones. Would actually be more secure.\n- operations processes at apple.\n- Working at a big company really brainwashes you into worshipping the company. -shallowness. What does it mean?\n- what is the tingly feeling? It's nervousness, from when you feel like the other person is out of your leagues\n\nLinda's driving was mega scary and Xuehai was super tired. I asked Rox if she could drive, but she didn't want to. I think she hadn't heard my conversation with Xuehai about how I didn't have my license so she didn't know what that meant. I drove for some of the highway route. Wasn't so bad.\n\nGot to NYC around 9pm. Met up with Felix for dinner. We ate at Kenka - the Japanese restaurant that serves cow penises. We ended up getting penis, testicle, and a variety of other random stuff. Linda swore that she would not eat such body parts, and pretty ate nothing the rest of the night because she was scared of everything. She wouldn't even touch the cutlery after it had touched the testicles\n\nFelix took us to a speak easy nearby - the hot dog restaurant one. You go into the restaurant and on the side there's a telephone booth. If you go up to the phone booth and ring, the person will ask you how many people you have. If they can fit you, the wall of the phone booth opens up to the bar. Unfortunately when we went it seemed to be closed. They had an \"out of order\" sign on it. Clever.\n\nWe went to Milk and Honey next, another speak easy. On the outside it was literally just a metal door. No signs, no nothing. Inside looked super cosy, completely packed. We managed to get a table and they said they don't order drinks with an actual menu. Just tell the waiter what kind of taste you're looking for and he makes it for you. Everything we had tasted amazing. Felix talked about how he's picked up brazillian jiujitsu, is doing Starting Strength along with the galon of milk a day, and we talked about his jobs.\n\nFelix left us to go do work and we went to Le bain, a super classy club at the top of the standard, has a nice view of the city. We were supposed to meet up with Andrew Wu, but he bailed last minute, pretty disappointing. Le bain turned out to have mediocre music and an older crowd. We got a crepe on the roof and then just chilled by the indoor pool. I figured I didn't want to miss the opportunity so I jumped in the pool. No one else wanted to join me. We didn't really do much else there and left after a bit. Funny that the place was 4 $ signs on yelp and yet it was the cheapest place we went (since we only bought a crepe).\n\n\n\n\n", 1367726400=>"Flew into TorontoGot a ride from Jason at the airport, went to T&T to get some ramen and other supplies - the dim sum shop there is okay\n\nChilled at Jason's playing Wii sports and writing entries til night\n\n\n\nWent to airport to pick up Jamie, then went off to Waterloo\n\nMet up with Carlie and Eric and ate at Mel's - the food is pretty pricey for Waterloo but it was really good tasting\n\n\n\nMet up with Andrew and Victoria and chilled til 6am - talking about what's good about certain American states, their jobs, etc\n\nWatched Psych and Community then went to bed\n\n\n\n\n", 1403323200=>"Bumped into Ursula on the way back from Graphics. She said she just finished class for the day so I invited her to come with for free food at E5 (Michael had just messaged saying there were some) and invited her to come dumpling with us\n\nMet up with Lucie and Jamie at the chinese supermarket and shopped for dumpling ingredients.\n\nSplit up since not enough car space. The others went to costco, I went with Jamie to get badminton stuff from his place then went to ours to set up. At his place we got to talking about my speech and I showed him the video for Tomorrowland 2013. Really can't get tired of that. Looks so amazing.\n\nGot started with cleaning our place / making the meat for dumplings. The others showed up and we began our production line. Rox kneaded the skins, me and jason flattened them, and the others folded them. My hand was throbbing by the end of the night. We made 16 boxes or so, which we calculated would have put us at below minimum wage given the number of people we had / time we spent assuming we sold at the same price as the dumpling shop in the plaza.\n\nMet up with Nicole, Kyle, and Michael and we went to Molly's. This was the first time Kyle drank more than a beer in his life. Matt was also there and he bought Kyle a 3-shot pitcher. I bought him a couple shots. Ended up being a pretty hilarious evening, though once again a super costly one. At this point it pretty much doesn't feel worth it to go out drinking like that. The fun-memorable events ratio is no good.\n\nAfterwards Kyle came with to chill at our place. Me, him, Sean, and Lux talked about life for a bit. I don't remember much of it. Kyle told a story about the time he was egged by some chick who got super mad at a comment he made. Later on he was in the same class as her and she didn't even remember him. I forget the exact story, but when Kyle told it it was hilarious", 1388811600=>"Fantastic day on the slopes. Got my groove going, felt like I improved a ton. My max speed is roughly 50kmph. The turning knee inwards thing helped a lot. Getting better really just takes practice. It's hard to say exactly what I've changed. Leaning more confidently? But definitely feel much better about my boarding. We did some off-pistes. Those are great since you can just do whatever and not worry about other people. But if you screw up and go too far off, the virgin snow is too deep and you get stuck. Otherwise you can speed down the slopes and have to lean back a bit.\n\nKind of figured out carving near the end on one flat part, but didn't end up getting it again after.\n\nAt one point some people on the lifts started blasting swedish house mafia and sang along to it. I joined in and we were laughing at each other.\n\nSummit by skrillex is very fitting music for boarding. Other than that, eric prydz is fantastic in the playlist.\n\nFrance really does not have lines. Even for lifts it's just people clumping together. Pretty awful.\n\nFor dinner I had foie gras at the fancy restaurant that's part of the hotel. Super expensive but very delicious. The foie gras had some lobster in it. Very interesting combination. Entree was filet mignon. Sean explained that filet mignon is supposed to be aged for a long time and its supposed to practically melt in your mouth. It's not supposed to be medium rare.\n\n\n\n\n", 1369800000=>"Psych was canceled due to construction - we couldn't get into our classroom. Spent the time having an omgpop party, haven't played in so long. Jason and Nicole were playing, then we had a bunch of random other people join in.\n\nWent to first hip hop with Nicole and Jamie. Saw Zack and Vivian again. The choreo was pretty good and although I was iffy on parts, I actually managed to keep up with it this time. Jamie seemed to struggle a lot. He says he's not very good at muscle memory stuff like this.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nA bunch of stuff about how our body works from studying psych. It's actually pretty interesting. I'll probably write a blog post\n\nFor Cars 2 it took 11.5 hours to render one frame. The computationally heavier ones took up to 90 hours.

We headed to Laurel Creek to picnic there. Talked about the singularity, Europe, how she collects stamps and vinyls. Couldn't find the official entrance to Laurel Creek and went in through some side trail. Got the crap bitten out of us by mosquitoes and so gtfo-ed.\n\nWandering around, stumbled upon a YMCA. Pretty legit pool and gym setup there, lots of kids for a summer camp I assume.\n\nWe took a bus back to campus and walked through MKV and V1. Got mega nostalgia, thinking back to 1A. Ate at a picnic bench by V1 while Rui shared some photos from Europe. Also talked about her best and worst days. She's really great at photography, really captured the essence of the scenes and the greatness of the blue skies. Makes me want to go back.\n\nTook a bus to Yeti, but it turned out to be closed. Checked out a nearby music shop. Vinyls are actually super expensive - $20-30 each. Some couple bought two hundred dollars worth when we were there. Then went to a game shop next door and I inquired about smash bros. They sell it for $75. Can't believe a 15 year old game is more expensive than a new xbox game. Chilled at Pyrus Cafe after. Great environment, wouldn't mind working there. Talked about Electric Forest and Maple Story. Rui used to be a super hardcore player. Kept spreadsheets for calculating stuffs and made MMVs and everything.\n\nIt began pouring when we left, so we ran as fast as we could to the Chinese Supermarket, got hot pot ingredients, then took the closest bus back to loo. By the time we got to loo the rain stopped and the weather got gorgeous. Prepped for hot pot, then people started coming over.\n\nThe final headcount: Me, Xuehai, Rox, Jason, Sean, Lux, Rui, Austin (from SPCOM), his gf Ginelle, Ursula, Rox's new friend Mei, and Rui's friends Rebecca and Joyce. Hot pot went smoothly for the most part. Jason explained how the fat near the arm pits is the best part of the female body / how it's better than breasts and Mei, Rebecca, and Joyce died of laughter. Literally couldn't breathe kind. Throughout the night some interesting conversation about Maple Story and anime. Ginelle likes to start conversations by saying \"ask a question\". Pretty interesting, but feels like a strange conversation starter to me. The dynamics of it are weird. Jason at one point told a story about how when his parents used to beat him, they'd schedule the beating. \"You're getting 20 slaps at 7pm tonight\" and he'd just show up and take them. Seems there's a common theme of beatings when we were younger and not trusting dishwashing machines. Ginelle told us about the psychology exam to see if you're a serial killer, super interesting. Apparently people who are serial killers answered it in the same way. \"A woman dies. She has two daughters. At her funeral a mysterious man shows up and the older daughter falls in love at first sight. The next day the older daughter kills the younger sister. Why?\" Answer: to see the man again. \"Two condos are next to each other. A man lives in one and another guy wanting to kill him lives in the other. The man goes onto his balcony and sees the killer in the other doing a stroking motion of sorts. What's the killer doing?\" Answer: counting the floors to the man's place. The first question, after all of us gave up, Rui still refused and went outside to think harder about it. She's super persistent. The second question, Jason went onto our balcony and did the hand motion in hopes that it'd give him inspiration. Everyone inside got a mix of laughter / chills.\n\nAround 2, people left and I showed Rui my SPCOM speeches. Still can't watch my steak speech. Too much cringe. Definitely noticeable improvement from first to last speech in terms of filler words and flow, but still much room for improvement in hand gestures, vocal variation, facial expressions, and swaying. We talked some more, made out some, and cuddled til we fell asleep. I tried escalating further, but she wasn't down. I still don't really have a clue what is too fast / too aggressive/ what is good in general. Apparently Rui only agreed to the first date because she saw that I was friends with Kevin Lau and that we watched Suits together, so I probably wasn't a creepy guy or anything. Got inadvertently wingman-ed.\n\n\n\n\n", 1368676800=>"Checked out our 3A study room. No windows but has A/C, good internet, lots of plugs. Decent enough\n\nWatched Google I/O - new google maps and sending money through email is way awesome\n\nWent to first core/core yoga shoetag with jamie. Bonnie was at the core one. Core yoga sandy and nicole were also there. It was entirely girls there aside from us three guys. Core yoga was very different from the vinyasa kind I'd done. It entirely had to do with using the yoga ball. I was terrible at it\n\nWent to mr sushi afterwards with nicole jamie sandy and their friend alice. Had to leave before food arrived to get internet fixed\n\nGot internet fixed / discovered we have ethernet - brought our connection up to a blazing 1.5 mbps.\n\nHad quality roommate bonding time with both rooms.

Turned out to be pretty comfortable, could easily fit two people. Neither of us were really tired though so we went and got Boston Cream donuts. Patrick woke up shortly after and came and fetched us. We went to his place and since we missed the party, Lucie joked we should take morning shots. This became a thing for the rest of the trip. Took shots every morning at 5am, then passed out shortly after.\n\nIn the morning when we woke up, Mark and Eric came over to meet up with us. Patrick had some chores to do, so Mark gave us a tour around Boston. On the way we bumped into a lady walking a pig. Apparently there's another pig in Boston and he's a celebrity on instagram.\n\nWe walked around the outside of the Museum of Modern Art and posed with the creepy baby statues, then walked through some park with pretty fountains that we jumped through and played around in. We passed by many universities that I'd never heard of. Apparently there are over 30 in the area.\n\nGrabbed lunch at Thorton's. Eric ordered an Eggs Benedict but asked for the muffin to be swapped out with a croissant. They joked that that'd be now named after Eric. We put our phones on the table and Eric looked at mine and asked if it was a fake. He said the shine wasn't quite the same as a normal iPhone. I did get mine from a Chinese dealer after all and it was quite strange that there were Chinese apps in the settings. Now it all made sense. Crazy that he could tell just from looking at it.\n\nAfter lunch Mark showed us a store called Bodega. From the outside it looks like an old school convenience store. When you're inside, there's a vending machine that slides open to reveal a hidden shoe store. Everything inside was way too pricey, but still super cool concept.\n\nChecked out MIT campus. James, Dave, Patrick, and Julian met us there. We stopped by the swag shop and then climbed some statues. Passed by a guy wearing a Twitter Boston shirt. We thought about visiting Twitter. I contacted Wen Hao but it didn't really pan out.\n\nGrabbed drinks at the Liberty Hotel. It used to be a prison, but is now instead a super fancy bar / hotel. There was a wedding party going on, saw a dog in a tux. We decided there we'd have drinking duels for the rest of the evening. The person I was to match shots with was Lucie.\n\nPatrick and them went back home to drop off their bikes and bags since we weren't kayaking today anymore. Also was too late to do the brewery tour, so we said we'd just meet up at another bar.\n\nWent to a bar called Hill Tavern and did several rounds of shots. One of them was a super cute one called Baby Guinness. I forget what was in it, but it looked just like Guinness.\n\nWent to the Italian district to get some nice seafood, but the restaurant we planned to go to, we waited in line for an hour and still hadn't gotten in, so just decided fuck it and ate at a non-sit down restaurant that had lobster rolls and clam chowder. The place turned out to be super legit. Best lobster roll I've had so far. So much lobster in it.\n\nTook the metro to the Prudential, the tallest building in Boston, and went up to the penthouse bar. Nice view of Boston and good live music. We felt way under dressed though, and it was hard to find seating. Nice tasting fancy drinks.\n\nWent back to Patrick's and they called their friends over and we got a house party going. Felt super fratty in there, the true American experience. Many girls showed up, but I didn't really feel any motivation to talk to them. We played some beer pong and danced. At one point Mark said for every shot he and I took, we should trade shirts. Soon we began trading shirts with other people too and it became a thing the rest of the night. Lucie and Rox even joined in. Patrick got with one of the girls that we didn't know. He barely spoke a word to her the whole night and somehow they got to making out.\n\nMark ended up getting way too drunk and could barely walk. I told him I'd walk him home but he refused. Anthony came and helped me take Mark home. What we thought would be a quick task ended up being a 2-3 hour ordeal. Mark constantly fought us, ran away from us, and refused to tell us his address. At one point we ran into some stranger and Mark tried to get him to get us away from him. I think his name was PJ. He coaxed the address out of Mark and we parted ways with him. Even after getting the address it was a complete pain. We knew where we were headed finally, but Mark still kept fighting us. At one point I raged super hard and cussed him out telling him to just let us take him home. He was being completely irrational and it drove me nuts. I definitely am still not dad material. Totally would end up hitting my kid or something if they were being immature like that. In the end, Anthony got the brilliant idea of calling a taxi and we finally managed to get Mark home. Definitely could not have managed that night without Anthony's help.\n\nHeaded back to Patrick's place and the party had already died down. Some guy was still talking to Lucie at that point, having the most mind numbing conversation I'd ever taken part in. He was just repeatedly talking about obliques and I actually wanted to shoot myself. I assume that's part of his flirting technique but god it was awful. Eventually he left and we all passed out.\n\n\n\n\n", 1377576000=>"London airport was ridiculous - you have to check in 45 minutes early and you have to go through security, even when it's a connection flight. By the time I got through security I was only 35 minutes early so they wouldn't let me on the flight. Had to take one 2 hours later.\n\nOnce I got to Lyon, customs was super easy. \"échange?\" \"oui\". Then I was through. Bussed without much trouble to INSA campus. Dropped off bags with Magdalena. There were Chinese exchange students there, which was kind of weird. They were speaking in broken English with Magdalena. Why go to a French-speaking country??\n\n\n\nWalked to hotel and checked in. After settling in, went for a walk around the nice city center area. Lyon is a pretty decent city.\n\n\n\n\n", 1377921600=>"Woke up at almost noon. Bought worst pair of flip flops I've ever seen from 99 cent store. The sides jabbed your feet when you had them on and the bottoms had no grip whatsoever so I kept almost slipping as I walked with them.\n\nChecked out gypsy market - Jamie haggled a belt for 6 euros\n\nAte lunch at some place that was highly rated on TripAdvisor. The food was decent - got some type of pasta that I don't know the name of with wild boar sauce\n\nWalked towards our next destination and hit up a place that had good wifi. Found a geocache nearby and did it. Not a particularly interesting one, was behind a sign for a hotel.\n\nTrekked to Piazza Michelangelo. Great view of the entire city from there.\n\nSat on a ledge, basked in the view, and talked about life for two hours - 40 days of dating, good to exude good vibes but that doesn't mean shouldn't share problems. just means don't lash out when you have problems, you can still talk about them and be open but deal with it on your own, we miss relationships when we don't have them since there's an emptiness where there used to be a huge part of your life. doesn't necessarily mean we miss that exact relationship, 80-20 principle, want to be a thick T, level of superlatives in languages - we completely abuse words so that they lose their meaning (awesome, fantastic, etc). Jamie says Cirque du Soleil is actually epic in the real sense of the word, \n\nWent back and hit up a hole-in-the-wall restaurant along the way called Tripp and Zampa. I asked what he recommended and he served me some pasta dish with a Florencian bolognese meat sauce. Al dente and quite tasty. \n\nSpent rest of night researching next couple days' plans, doing laundry, and social media. Didn't end up meeting with Kirsten as she never responded. \n\n\n\n\n", 1391144400=>"Made quiche for lunch with Merike. We watched some chopped and iron chef. Both shows are so insane, I wanna get better at speed cooking like that. At the same time their plating is always so crazy good and they do such fancy stuff. So much left to learn.\n\n\n\nComputer broke so spent rest of afternoon trying to get that fixed. Did alright communicating with Genius Bar guy in French, but when I mentioned I needed it done today because I was moving to California tomorrow, he switched to perfect English. Pretty funny.\n\n\n\nDinner at McDonald's with Sam. Discussed technology and whether it's good or bad all the things that are happening with it. Sam taught me some history. Mao wasn't a very smart man and everything he tried was destroying the country. He was just very good at spinning things positively. Hitler on the other hand was very clever.

The prof told us about the tiger experience - close your eyes and imagine the following scenario: A tiger walks through the jungle, the light shining on its fur. The tiger strides into the lake, the water running across its body and rippling along as it moves. The tiger gets out of the water, water dripping from its soaked fur. It shakes the water off and droplets fly in all directions.\n\nOur brains are able to in real time create imagery for all of that, from the fluid dynamics to the lighting effects. We still can't just take a tiger model and put it through a water model. We have to do a bunch of artistic hacks, etc to get it looking as we'd imagine. So the bad news is: we still have a long way to go in graphics. But at the same time, the good news is: we still have a long way to go in graphics. Thought it was a great way to end the course, very hopeful for the future. Also makes you realize how crazy it is that our brains can do these kinds of things. When I discussed it later with Sean, we got to talking about what if we could meta program our brains - change it to be optimized for what we want. Pretty cool concept for a short film maybe.\n\nAt groceries with Sean and Jason, we bought 4 watermelons and I put them all in my backpacking bag. Probably the most weight I've carried from groceries, finally putting that weightlifting to good use.\n\nAfter groceries headed to Last Bomber. We got there around 7 and the line was still pretty short. Got some food and chilled. Started with Jamie, Wen Hao, Xuehai, Rox. Later the pharmers joined, and throughout the night met many random friends of the other people. Bumped into Tharindu and we did an awkward handshake exchange where I tried to shake his hand, but somehow went from below, and he went for a fist bump. Later in the night I somehow ended up in a group with two of Rox's friends and Wen Hao. No idea where everyone else went. Didn't feel sociable at that point, a bit of a strain throughout the entire night from all the new faces, so I just headed home.\n\nLater Anthony, Wen Hao, Xuehai and Rox came over and ate watermelon. Anthony had never eaten it with a spoon before. He got kicked out of bomber for leaving too long because there was a smash tournament going on outside.  Rox was close to passing out, she looked really sick. Never seen her that drunk before.

And shipping code is important!!\n\n\n\nEnjoyed more pleasant conversation with Clay and Ethan as always. Again was surprised by how well Rox bonded with new people, or rather her ability to make friends.\n\n\n\n\n", 1361077200=>"Went to Heavenly in morning. I basically did a terrible job teaching people. I got easily frustrated when people didn't listen (how get people to listen?), and my advice was generally not easy to understand..? We did bunnies, then greens and was basically on the same green for rest of day.\n\n\n\nLast minute found hotel through Hotwire, which turned out to actually be pretty nice, but def should not last minute book hotel like that again. \n\nAte Chinese food down the street. Egg Foo Young / Happy Family are both pretty interesting. Egg Foo Young is basically omlette but better, Happy Family is EVERYTHING.\n\n\n\nDrank a bit at hotel, though crowd was not right for partying. Half people weren't interested. We had Four Lokos, they tasted like crap. Got Naveen to drink a sip and that was pretty much it. Despite no successful drinking games, night turned out okay - interesting conversations with Alexey, Kris, Roxanne. Rest of kids played Big 2. Jamie and Jack beer ponged.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\nIt may have seemed like Reddit took funding \"too early\" since they're now way epic big, but Alexey spoke to Alexis (co-founder) and apparently timing was just right, as they were actually about to tank. Things are not always as they appear. Things were falling apart internally apparently due to Aaron Swartz. Even though he was super smart, he was impossible to work with (not the kind of thing you'd hear post mortem).\n\n\n\nUber is actually highly technically interesting for dev. Google maps wasn't good enough, often estimates were off by 10 min or more, so they built their own system based on cab driver routes, weather, events in the area, etc. It is usually within 1 min.\n\n\n\nExperiment: people surveyed on if they think they're lucky. They're then asked to count the number of pictures in a newspaper. Fourth page had a pic that said in it \"stop counting, there's 140 pics in this newspaper.\".

Don't know why I even bother going to that class\n\nDinner with Rox at that new dumpling place. Turned out to be owned by a family friend of hers. They kept giving us extra food and at the end gave us the meal for free. We talked about our exchange experiences, our love lives\n\nWent for drinks after. Rox wanted wine, and the only place in the plaza that was open that had it was East Side. Xuehai and Ryan came to join us. After one drink, Rox said her Pharm friends wanted to meet up. We met them at Morty's. Lucie is pretty cute. We could order from 1-15 wings for the Thursday Wings Special so I got just one wing.

I think with more classes I'll definitely get better at thinking on my feet.\n\nRight before Tweet Feet was supposed to happen, a protest occurred downstairs. People were shouting \"Twitter Twitter you're no good, pay your taxes like you should\". Apparently we have subsidies or something and pay less taxes than the poor? Don't really understand that stuff. By the time I headed down for Tweet Feet, they dispersed. Don't really see what good a half hour protest does, but I guess power to the people.\n\nFor Tweet Feet ran on my own so didn't have much motivation and ended up doing a lot of walking. Still kept the pace at 10min/mi though. Somehow there was talk of doing a Tuesday Poker night. Convinced Daniel and Collins to come for it. They played passively, which is typical of beginners. Daniel played pretty loose, while Collins played really tight. There was one hand where Brian pushed all in. I put him on AJ, which meant he had a straight. I had top 2 pair and folded. Collins had a set and also folded. Everyone else went berserk. I shouldn't have put him on just one hand. And based on his play, that wouldn't have made sense, since the flop he would have been drawing and wouldn't have called for the odds. So it was very likely he had 2 pair or was bluffing, and in either case I would have had better. I didn't expect the set, in which case it was even more of a snap call for Collins. He definitely shouldn't have folded. But we were too noob and Brian played the bluff by predicting we'd fold.\n\nAfter Collins busted, we left early and I went home to edit the Lyon video. Got it to a point where it looked alright, but I wasn't very happy with the footage. Didn't take enough cool footage. In the end I couldn't even upload it since FCP was giving me problems.

U of T has a couple of weird pun-song-game things - Cindy Bear, Chicago Department Store, Orgy song. \n\n\n\nMorning did the upper section of the river - Chili Bar. A couple big rapids, quite enjoyable. Rapids are formed by rocks of different elevations / textures on the ground and rivers becoming narrower / wider. They're basically little waterfalls. The water is just flowing with gravity, trying to fill the holes.\n\n\n\nHad a lunch back at the campsite - sandwiches, pineapple.\n\nWent into the lower section of the river - forget the exact names but all the rapids had names related to hospitals - emergency room, etc. We passed a frisbee between our two rafts. Got to do some white water swimming - in one of the deeper rapids we got to jump in and bob along the rapids. Very interesting experience, feels kinda like a roller coaster ride, and you have to breathe at the right moments or you'll swallow lots of water. Also go to do a 360 off of a large rock on the side. I somehow was the only one to flip out of the boat there. We also ollied off of a rock in the middle of the stream at one point. There were many more / better rapids than the morning. Still would've liked to do Middle or North Fork (4/4+ rapids) instead of just South Fork which was 3ish rapids.\n\n\n\nAs we approached the end the currents calmed and we had to paddle several miles to the pickup point. We were quite a ways ahead of the other rafts and when we noticed they were paddling harder to catch up, we decided to do the same. A motor boat passed by and the rafts behind us hitched a ride with the boat. We could not let them beat us to the end in such a cheap way so we paddled even harder. We did end up getting to the end before them, but I was super sore for the rest of the day because of that.\n\n\n\nWe heard there was a city nearby called \"Cool\" so we decided to grab dinner there. Cool, California turned out to be only about 2 blocks long. The pizza shop there was not bad - everything on the menu was named after rafting-related stuff.

Alex argued that no one should ever do unpaid internships because that means the employers don't actually value you and wouldn't give you any legit work. I stated that sometimes you have to do such bitch work to get a foot in the industry. Not everyone has the opportunities we do. We also talked about how crazy it is that we pump so many amps into CPUs and they don't burn up.\n\n\n\nGot back just in time to catch game of thrones with the SF crew.

Checked out the crazy good street performers, the Alice in Wonderland statues, and thought about all the movies that have taken place in the park.\n\nWalked towards Times Square, stopping by the Apple Store of course. We took out our 4 iphones and did some meta selfie-ing in the store. Afterwards Linda left us to meet up with her other friends.\n\nRox, Xuehai and I were going to the nintendo store, but was closed before we got there. Instead we went to halal guys. Just as delicious as Salman had raved about. And super cheap. Would go again for sure. Hit up the M&M mega store. Can't believe there's a huge store just for M&Ms. We went in the photo booth and did one of those reels.\n\nWalked around Times Square in all its touristy glory. Decided we wanted to see a broadway show from looking at all the ads. All of the wake-up-early-for-cheap-tickets for good ones were lotteries. We didn't wanna leave it up to luck, so just found one that wasn't that expensive without the lottery. We decided on one that was starring Daniel Radcliffe. Would be cool to see the dude in real life. There was also one starring Neil Patrick Harris, but it was $500 for crappy tickets.\n\nStopped by Grand Central Station very briefly, then went to dinner at Tony di Napoli. Met up with Kevin Zhang, Alex, and one of Kevin's friends Sarah. Food was family style and super tasty. Andrew was supposed to meet us for dinner, but he ended up bailing again.

Rox was supposed to be part of the founding team, but she decided she didn't want to do it. Super small world.\n\nMet back up with Linda, Felix, and Linda's friend Akash at another speak easy. This one wasn't as discrete, but the drinks were just as tasty. We played Never have I ever, which made me super uncomfortable. Pretty much everything revolved around sex and literally everyone else was much more accomplished than I in the area. Akash is the one who started the Velocity Kegger thing I had heard stories about. He brought kegs into the rez when the dons were gone and turned the great hall lights to strobe lights / invited a DJ. Amazing.", 1406347200=>"Lunch with Anthony, Steve, Rox at Shawarma Plus. Supposedly the best restaurant in Waterloo according to Trip Advisor. Was decent, but didn't think it was anything super epic.\n\nWent to Zumba with Stephane, Lindsey, Nicole. Had no idea what to expect. It was in the large gym where they play dodgeball and the whole thing was filled with girls. I had never seen so many girls in one place in Waterloo before. Aside from me and Stephane there was only one other guy. The sheer number of girls was actually pretty intimidating. Zumba turned out to be pretty similar to some of the moves from Insanity, but not as fast. Some parts I felt like I was part of a native tribe and we were doing a tribal ritual to sacrifice animals. I ended up drenched in sweat. Not a bad workout. When we were leaving I noticed someone else with the Taylor Swift bag.

I don't remember any of their names anymore, it wasn't a particularly memorable meal.\n\nAfterwards we dropped off Jason and picked up Christina. Went to Kitchener and chilled there. There was some sort of boxing tournament set up outside, some sort of festival for the weekend. They had a free mechanical bull and we all gave that a try. Rox tried first and stayed on for a good half minute. We were like wut, so easy. Xuehai tried next and fell within a second. I tried and fell within 3 seconds. Ended up going to Imbibe, the bar attached to the Museum. They have a bunch of local craft beers and swap out the taps every day. The vibe there's pretty good. Would go again. Christina got a taste of what it will be like to live with us - she got pretty uncomfortable when we talked about sex and stuff. That part of her is still pretty Asian. Bumped into George Wang at Imbibe. He came up to our table and asked if we had any gum, since he just consumed some goat cheese. We didn't have any, but Christina had some perfume and he said he'd give that a try.

Holy crap. Started out at 4:30 when we went to the bridge for bungee jumping. The place was super sketch and everything was completely dark. As the sun came out, the day became better and better. We learned the basics of bungee and jumped away. The actual jumping was not so great. Very painful on the lower regions and lasts only a few seconds. When you bounce back up and down it's pretty scary, there's the rollercoaster feeling. I wish the initial jump was longer. Also there wasn't great video or pictures captured for my jump. But oh well. It's an item off my bucketlist. Watching other people's jumps was much more entertaining. Rox screamed the whole way for hers and beforehand proclaimed “妈妈我爱你”. Khalil had a periodic scream / he actually hit the water with his feet. Romain did an extremely graceful swan dive. We did a bear paw for Joyce's second one - four people held her up from below and ran, then tossed her over. It's pretty crazy throwing someone off a bridge. Someone from the group that we didn't know also did a bear paw, and we helped, but that one almost turned out badly. She grabbed the instructor and Patrick at the very end out of fear, and could have possibly pulled them over the edge with her / she almost hit the metal railing. After the other people started leaving, the instructor asked us if we wanted to throw the boat that was on the side of the road over the bridge. We were going to do it, but then other people started showing up to fish, and we decided against it. Apparently the instructor has bungee jumped off a bridge while riding a bike.\n\n\n\nAfter bungee we grabbed much needed food, which was in Groveland on the other side of a super narrow alley. As soon as we sat down, Khalil noticed there was wifi, and EVERYONE pulled out their devices. It's shocking how reliant we are on technology these days. While we were waiting for food, the waitress brought us crackers for the soup we were about to have. Considering how starving we were, we devoured all the crackers pre-food.\n\nFollowing food we went to Yosemite. We tried climbing up to a tiny waterfall and I ended up slipping on the rocks and plummeting into the water. It wasn't that bad, but I was soaked. We then went to Yosemite Valley and went to the lower falls. We all attempted to climb a tree on the way there. At the fall we decided we should try to climb it to get closer. We got extremely close. It was crazy you could feel the drizzle and strong winds from the falls.\n\nWe decided that so much awesomeness happened unplanned because of the dynamic of the group. We were a very \"yes\" group, agreeing to any cool thing people thought of, and we didn't have much planned and made plans as we went along in an agile methodology sort of way.\n\n\n\n\n", 1394082000=>"Poker night after work, though I didn't partake since I had work to do.

I totally didn't know how to map and reduce properly, despite having written code for that for the past 4 months. Only afterwards did I realize how map and reducing really worked. I should have just thought in terms of the TypedPipe and Grouped monads for what mapping and reducing can do. Also I screwed up in figuring out how to keep track of N largest numbers. Should have been with a min heap that popped out the min to keep the max n, as opposed to a tree or max heap.\n\n\n\nWent back to work and attempted to code while Dan and Victor and Ben played tractor. Did not make much progress though so I headed back home.\n\nI tried opening the gate to Chris'  place but the key wasn't working. It went all the way in but wasn't turning. There was a cat there and the owner's door was left open, so I thought about calling out to that person to open the gate. After I struggled a while I called Chris for help since I figured I looked super sketch trying to open the gate for so long. He came downstairs and called me and asked where I was. That was when I realized I was at the wrong block. \n\nWe watched Ip Man til pretty late\n\n\n\n\n", 1395547200=>"In the morning Collins, Ryan, Eric and I got food from the cafe down the street - Nook. Not bad food, a bit overpriced. Funny how we've lived here so long and haven't even been to the place right across the street.\n\n\n\nEric left after breakfast and the three of us embarked on our biking day. Took the cable car (another first!) down to the bike shop and rented bikes. Everyone that worked there were super ecstatic and happy go-lucky. We biked down to the presidio, went across the bridge, then went through sausalito to tiburon. Tiburon was a first and was quite gorgeous. Very quaint area. Lots of young moms that were probably just a bit older than me. Kinda scary to think about. Then at the harbor it was mostly old people. \n\n\n\nAt Tiburon we grabbed a really quick lunch of Pizza. When the guy asked Ryan what topping he wanted, he said meatball. The guy said \"we don't have that today\" and Ryan responded \"sorry\". So Canadian.\n\n\n\nWe took the ferry from there to Angel Island. We passed many legit bikers with their triathlon tights and stuff, and it got me thinking about how that whole thing works. Those people get people to pay them lots of money so that they can get in shape..? If it's not friends, they get company sponsors and the companies do it just so their logos can be seen by people for just a few seconds? None of it makes much sense to me.\n\n\n\nAngel Island we tried biking up, but our bikes were not made for that terrain and the slopes were a bit treacherous. We brought the bikes back down then hiked up. Not the most epic hike I've done but you do get a really cool 360 view of the entire bay at the end\n\n\n\nWe hiked down and had a bit of time to spare so Collins taught me to do a shoulder freeze. It's a really good oblique workout.\n\n\n\nTook the ferry back and I went home to shower while the other two grabbed dinner. Met up with Tiffany and Clay for dinner at U Lee then grabbed ice cream up north at Swensen's. Patrick's coming to visit the 4/20 weekend apparently. I invited them to our Happy Hour. Tiffany and Clay stopped by my place and Tiffany kept commenting on how messy it is, etc. I really should do a better job of being clean as a normal habit.\n\n\n\nCollins came over after and we looked over the footage from snowboarding and biking. The snowboarding footage was okay, but the biking was crap whenever I had it on the bike handle. Should have looked at the footage after mountain biking. It's so shaky it's pretty much unusable.\n\n\n\n\n", 1357189200=>"First day of work. Other coops are pretty cool, boss is pretty cool.

Got up to finish up packing and did nothing at work all day. Productivity was legitly 0.\n\nWent to lunch with all the interns and managers at Fang. That place is not good at all. Food portions were small, and food did not taste good. Heard that marmite and vegemite are super gross, as well as goat cheese ice cream. Should give these things a try one day.\n\n\n\nBefore leaving work tried on the Appman costume! It is super stuffy in there. Found out afterwards there's a fan built into the top of it.\n\nWent to Flytrap after work with Daryl and co. Had long island ice teas - supposedly very strong mixed drink.

It sounded really badass too - crossbones made of 1s and 0s, then on the other side it says \"Coding. It's terminal\". Also worked out for the second time this term. I think we'll really keep it up this time, maybe get real results. We got protein! I did power cleans for the first time.

Rahul afterwards went up to Waylon and was like \"why did he say that hurt? Was it.. yee er yee er yee er (finger in hole gesture)\", unaware that Waylon's gay and that was actually his boyfriend. Waylon responds no man, we've only been dating for a month. It's not like that. Rahul went poker faced.\n\n- Jason: \"If you give birth to eight children, does that mean you have eight umbilical cords?

Puzzles involved turning off the lights to see the pattern on the wall, looking in the inner lid of a lid to get a screwdriver (there were four different screwdrivers needed to open a chest which had the answer sheet), pushing a button in the bottom of a drawer (deathnote-style) to get to a hidden compartment, finding items representing zodiac signs\n\nLaunch Hackathon - had trouble getting Naveen in since it appears each individual had to be registered, not just a team.

Andrew completely wrecked me on jason's. Pretty disappointed in myself for that one. I only got like two questions correctly\n\nWent to badminton club with Andrew and Jason. Very crowded at first and didn't get to play much. By the end we were basically playing non-stop. I apparently have a good serve but very much need to work on my smashing. It's cool how much you pick up while you play. I realized near the end that I didn't have to serve so close, I could try to serve it farther back to screw with the people. Not a great workout though. I guess decent in terms of socializing\n\n\n\n\n", 1346731200=>"Today and Sunday were basically the same. Woke up early to help Frosh move in. \"This won't be the first time your daughter has 10 guys in his room…\" You can tell a lot about a person by what and how much they move in. One of the craziest things I moved was a girl's hockey bag that was about the size of one and a half fridges. There was also a girl that had a dolly with 3 boxes of shoes on it. I must say there are quite a few good looking Frosh, but as Shawn said \"DFTFY - don't fuck the frosh yet\". Not that I'd even have a chance considering the current state of my social skills. Following was HQ set up time. This is one of my favorite things about Frosh Week. Doing crafts for half the day. I helped make a master sword, 2 bombs and a jug out of paper machee. Then I helped make two deku babas. Paper machee is fun but also a lot of work and gets pretty annoying and tiring after a while. I'm pretty proud of the deku babas. Taping it wasn't working well so I came up with the idea to use wire to \"sew\" the head to the body.\n\n\n\n\n", 1378094400=>"Long morning of transfers to get to Venice. At Venice we were very confused about vaporetto (water bus) system. There was a bus going in the opposite direction of what we wanted, we thought maybe if we went to the other side of the bridge there'd be one going in the right direction. This did not appear to be the case.\n\nWe took a random bus that got us a bit closer to where we wanted, then waited at least 30 minutes for the next bus. It appears that one was not running. Tired and annoyed with waiting, I did not have a very good impression of Venice so far. After a couple other buses, we finally made it to our hostel - almost 3 hours later\n\nLucy and Hatty were sitting outside the hostel, enjoying the water and scenery. This was by far the nicest hostel we've been to. Looks like a fancy 4 star hotel, and the wifi worked fine unlike Plus. The floor was marble, downstairs was a fancy bar and space for hanging. Our room had good locker space and the beds/pillows felt great. We dropped off our bags, spoke briefly to our roommate Martin from Switzerland (he recommended checking out Zurich and Bern), then joined the girls downstairs.\n\nWalked around in Venice admiring the scenes and the beautiful weather. I no longer had a bad impression of Venice. Apparently the vaporettos were terrible today only because of the Historical Regatta going on. We watched that for a bit, wasn't all that interesting. Just some teams of different types of boats racing/rowing through the canals. Walked into a room that was an art gallery. Smallest art gallery I've ever seen. Hatty exclaimed \"I could paint these\". There was one other lady in the room, she was the artist of the paintings. \n\nJamie and I hadn't eaten in several hours so we left the girls to get food. Ate at a fantastic restaurant called Corner Pub Snack Bar. First place that offered us tap water free of charge! We also got served delicious breadsticks. We ordered Cannelloni (kind of like burrito raviolis..?) and Melazane (some sort of eggplant parmesan dish); finally non-pasta/pizza dishes. As we left Jamie asked the friendly waiter if he knew of a good gelato place. He recommended a place called Gelato Squero. By far the best gelato I've had. Finally I understood the difference between ice cream and gelato, this texture actually tasted different. The flavors were extremely rich. When I asked the owner what flavor is the best, he said \"all of them\". Given I got 4 flavors and they were all great, I think he may have actually meant it and was not just copping out.\n\nHeaded back to the hostel and bought a bottle of wine from a restaurant nearby. Supposedly there's a supermarket nearby that sells 2 euro bottles of wine, but everything was closed already so the one we got was 12 euros. There was a circle of people our age sitting outside the hostel so we joined them. Over the night more and more people joined the circle, including Lucy and Hatty. Some of the others were David and Joe from Australia, Jennifer Axelle Victoria from France, Matt from Canada, Tom from Australia, James from San Fran, Jan from Switzerland, Ben from Minnesota, and others I don't remember the names of. Jan was fluent in 5 different languages, quite impressive. David and Joe were great at leading the conversation and hitting on the French chicks. They were pretty much all art-related majors. Made me realize how bad I am at talking to people I can't relate to as much and how bad I am at bantering/making clever remarks. Definitely still deficiencies in my socialization. We sat around and drank and talked til around 1 then went to bed. This felt like the real hostel experience. \n\n\n\n\n", 1388034000=>"Walked to Liberty statue. Nothing crazy. Visited the famous thermal bath - so many good looking couples. Definitely a couples event. It was basically a giant jacuzzi. Nothing mind blowing. Tried goulash there.

Indeed the decoration was completely crazy, nothing like any other pub. While at the clubbing part of the pub I struck out and didn't feel like dancing anymore. Too annoyed by all the desperate dudes.\n\nSome of the people from the hostel were exchange students in prague. they told me about the chill ness of their exchange:\n\nA prof didn't wanna give an exam so offered to give them all straight A's instead. Only one guy opposed, but it was democratic.\n\nOne of their profs was pregnant so their class happened through skype.

Worked at a kitchen to get money for drugs. Life turned around through kitchen, is now a chef\n\n\n\n\n", 1388898000=>"An awful day on the slopes. The snow was completely crazy, we couldn't see past a meter in front of us. At the same time it was really warm so the snow was slushy. The more weary I became, the slower I went and therefore the more I fell. Bad cycle. Sean and I got separated and he ended up going to 1800 and messaged me from there. I made my way down to the wrong 1800 and decided we'd just head home on our own.

Their tacos were okay. I assume their burritos are what they're known for.\n\n\n\nAfterwards was talking to Rui and she seemed super stressed and overwhelmed.

We managed to convince them that coop is really cool.\n\n\n\nGathering intel from the vicinity, the popular vote for a good hike seemed to be Cloud's Rest. We were warned that it would take about 7 hours, but none of us took it to heart and embarked with a meager quarter jug of water for the four of us. This would come back to haunt us. The arduous hike up required many breaks, but eventually we reached the top and reaped the fruits of our labor. A breathtaking 360 view from one of the highest points. You can see the half dome, valley, and everything else in the vicinity. Amazing.\n\n\n\nOn the way back down, we exhausted our short water supply and took a wrong turn at an intersection. Not fun. After hiking a mile or so in the wrong direction, the whole way of which we were questioning whether the route really was unfamiliar or if we were just really tired, we saw a lake which definitively showed we went the wrong way. Or we were incredibly blind on the way up and missed an entire lake. Across the lake we saw a black bear! The detour was not for naught. We went the wrong way because the sign said \"Sunrise\" which we thought we came from. Turns out that referred to Sunrise Trail whereas we came from Sunrise Parking. We got back extremely late. By the time we got back, it had been about 8 hours of hiking. I'd say roughly 18 miles.\n\n\n\nOn the way back we stopped by a Chinese American Fusion restaurant.

Though Waterloo really isn't a bad campus the more I think about it. We have a stream running through it and everything. Headed to beats place, where we made and ate saucisson aux choux. Quite simple to make. Boil sausage with leek, potatoes, onions, bouillon. Drain the water then eat.\n\nChecked out the campus bar.

It appears I said it louder than expected and the person sitting opposite to us gave me a really strange look. Jamie had a good laugh.\n\n\n\n- Did some cool long exposures at pergamon.

Didn't stay for that long but was good to see everyone again after a week\n\n\n\n\n", 1378267200=>"Flew to Copenhagen. Quite a culture shock this time around since we couldn't guess our way through things. The language was completely foreign, the currency also. Norwegian Airlines is great - free wifi, fast process. Landing in Copenhagen felt like traveling to the future. The airport is beautiful. The floors are sparking clean and the architecture was very modern. The baggage claim process was timed perfectly so that as soon as we got to it, our bags were coming out. The train's silent, pretty, very fast. They gave time estimates with 30 second precision. As we walked to the hostel I spazzed the whole way about how awesome this place was. There were electric charging stations, wind mill farms, attractive people, a lot of bikers (with lanes separating them from the cars!), fantastic weather, good mix of old buildings and modern ones.\n\nAt the hostel it was even better. They rented out ipads for free, the staff was incredibly nice, the wifi was crazy fast.\n\n\n\nThe hostel had free dinner at 6:30 so we walked around, then went to that.\n\nWalked around some more outside Tivoli and University of Copenhagen. Hit up Torst Bar. Prices were relatively cheap compared to other places, but of course was still obscene compared to elsewhere in the world. That's pretty much the one thing I don't like about Copenhagen.\n\nWent back to the hostel for happy hour. Sat with Ann and Marcus who we briefly met at dinner. Ann's from Germany, Marcus is from Austria. Ann recommended checking out Berlin and Freiburg (where she's from). Marcus said there wasn't much to see in Austria aside from Vienna. Ann studied inclusive education and art therapy - helping children through art. In Germany they have three tracks of education and she was on the middle one that involves apprenticeships. Marcus was in Copenhagen doing a double masters program exchange. He's doing economics and financial something. Some other girls joined our table - Emma, Iona, Mikaela, Jade. We told them how it was Jamie's birthday so they joined us the rest of the night as we bar hopped, getting Jamie his 22 birthday shots. They're all from England. Iona studies civil engineering.\n\n\n\nThe crowd in Copenhagen seems to be completely different. Venice pretty much everyone was a liberal arts major, here we met engineers, economists, forensic scientists.\n\n\n\nWe went to Heidi's Bar first to meet up with the girls' previous roommate Mark. Mark's Irish, has the best accent. There we played some foosball, talked about British drinking songs and games - there's a drinking song about \"___ is my mate, something something count to 8\" and they have to drink in 8 seconds. Drinking games were pretty much the same as those from Canada.\n\n\n\nApparently some of the other people in the bar were doing a pub crawl. We joined along with them as they continued to other bars. One dude was from NYC. He was living in Sweden playing ice hockey. We had a discussion about how British people call soccer football, and other silly sports-related things.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the night was much of the same. At one bar the bartender did a shot with Jamie (free) because it was his birthday and then they played a Danish birthday song on the speakers. It was a very strange and silly song. On the way to another bar Mark told us how in Ireland, when you go to an all-you-can-drink-in-an-hour bar as we were headed to, no one talks. It's called Power Hour (pawr awr ,as he pronounced it) and everyone just drinks as much as they can. Jamie just needed one more shot at this point and the thing would have cost us 60 krones, so we called it a night. We hit up a pizza shop to get Jamie some birthday pie. It was an interesting vegetarian pizza that didn't have tomato sauce. The topping was just squash and cheese.\n\n\n\n\n", 1394683200=>"Got a haircut after work at a place nearby. The haircut was mediocre, but afterwards the stylist vacuumed my face with an actual vacuum. And then she gave me a back massage. Weirdest haircut experience ever.\n\n\n\nNaveen needed me to stop by Lookout to pick up a package for him. When I went by the person who let me in had no idea that's what I was there for, and we couldn't find the package in the mail room, which wasn't unexpected since it had been two weeks since the delivery. Did the trip for nothing, but whatever. Just a short ride, no harm done.\n\n\n\nWent back to work in time for poker night. First time at a table with Ian Chan. Dan took Ian's stats along with his own and it seemed Ian was playing super loose - roughly 60% vpip. I ended in a showdown with Ian where I had a pair of Js, but on the river a K dropped. Ian raised and I backed out since I was scared that meant he had gotten pair of Ks. Turned out to be a bluff. So tricky.\n\n\n\nIn the end I lost all my money, but if I think about it, it's like a $20 3 hour poker lesson. Much cheaper than many of the other activities I've done. Definitely learned a ton about poker through playing with these people.\n\n\n\n\n", 1398744000=>"During lunch asked how come people pay 10x for playoff tickets? Brian and them gave comparisons to other things. How come pay more for cover on friday nights when could go out on monday nights? How come right before a big release people work harder?\n\nFound out I got an interview from Dropbox after all. Just a day earlier I was freaking out to Jamie about how Daniel got an interview but I didn't. They just got to my resume later is all.\n\nWatched smash documentary - the story of Izai (playing really well for a girl), Mew2King (analyzes the game frame by frame, seems to have asbergers), etc were really interesting. The game brings together people from all walks of life. It got me thinking about the community. Seems like a great community, but I don't think I'd fit in there. But it also got me thinking, what community do I really fit into? Everyone seems to have one of them that they're really close with and always have this common thing to talk about with. I just float between groups, not really fitting into any of them. It also got me thinking about pro gamers. What a crazy scene.\n\nAlso, being amazing at something is such a double edged sword. Especially for someone like Ken, who was 19 at the peak of his career. People forget how young you are when you're amazing, and they just bash and boo and cheer for the underdog. Probably has negative effects on childhood. Also it's crazy that only the best couple in the world get any livable amounts of money. I'm glad that I'm in a career where being mediocre still pays pretty well.\n\nAt dinner Justin had a friend over. Her name was Claudia. She looked really familiar and after talking a bit I realized I was matched with her on coffee meets bagel. Funny to bump into someone seen online offline. I don't know if we'd get along dating-wise, but she's certainly a fun and interesting person.\n\nDid a quick gym session on the 8th floor with Dan and Justin. Taught Dan how to do deadlifts and we also did some pushups. Played a quick heads up game of poker with Dan after and then studied for interviews by doing some algo and data structures practice.\n\n\n\n\n", 1393045200=>"Lunch with Salman. We agree that SF is a bit full of itself, but still is a great city. He caught me up on his life - moving to New York, getting engaged, etc. In New York being in a startup is actually a big deal. It's not a normal thing so people are excited when you talk about it. Someone saw Salman coding in a cafe once and was like \"whoa. Are you one of those wizard people?\". Unlike in SF where if you code, it's the norm and unless you have incredible MAUs or something, no one gives a shit about you.\n\nHappy hour with Jamie, Ian, another coworker. These people are all so smart. Got me thinking about how when I hang out with people like these, it's really memorable for me, but it's probably just another day in their life and they don't even remember the occasion.\n\n\n\nWe went to Dropbox so the recruiters could court Jamie and show him secrets to convince him to work for them. Recruiters are so damn good at being friendly and making conversation, I felt completely at ease with them. Didn't realize how fast the time flew. Jessica is also a really fun and interesting person. At Brown there's an intro CS class where the TAs deliver the professor a water bottle every class and made a skit out of the ritual. A different skit every time - Circle of Life style delivery, running away from Dementors, etc. They're very elaborate and show the freshmen that CS doesn't have to meet the stereotypes and can be fun too.\n\n\n\nBrown has a class on partner dancing and since it's all nerdy people, lots of people meet their future spouses in that class and invite the professor to their wedding because of it. The prof never attends since she doesn't know these people.\n\n\n\nWe went to Karaoke and invited Jessica and Shreena to come with. Somehow it turned into a Dropbox social as more and more Dropbox people showed up. They bankrolled the whole thing though - free drinks on them. Irish Car Bomb is very tasty. Soon we were clown carring in the room and Chris and his friends and Jon/Ash showed up super late and were all lolwut. We left shortly after for clubbing\n\n\n\nClubbing at the Grand. Drinks and cover were all obscenely expensive. It was completely full of Asians though. Never seen so many Asians in one club holy crap. Ran into Charles and Christina there!! They were too drunk for us to talk but still, crazy to see them.\n\n\n\nWent for waffles at a place down the street after. Talked with Chris' friend Sam some more. He's a really interesting guy. Knows a bunch of the people I know from MIT.\n\n\n\nTIL:\n\n\n\nTexting is essentially free for the providers.

Some of them were getting it on, we even saw an orgy. As we hiked back we noted there were many attractive girls. Good selection bias since anyone here could hike at least 10 miles. Definitely much better than the pick within the city. Tommy's knee started hurting so we took it a bit slow. He explained that when he was in college he did parkour, which is what really screwed up his knee. He did parkour so that he could do urban exploring. It's illegal, but you see some cool stuff - unfinished apartments, views from them that others wouldn't be able to, etc. He's done a lot of research into it and you can only get a misdemeanor for it in the states / canada. If a security guard stops you, run for it. If a cop stops you, don't go anywhere.\n\nHit up mission bbq after we got back. 4th time this term. Pretty sure that's more than I've been to anywhere else this term. We got there quite late and actually cleaned out the rest of their stock.\n\nOn the caltrain back ran into Eric and Collins.

We were discussing how it's dangerous that we only have two data centers. If someone bombed one of them, we'd be screwed. Then we started discussing anarchists blowing up data centers to fuck with the world and security at data centers.\n\n\n\nFor Clay's birthday I postmated him some cupcakes. Asked the delivery person to send 4-6 assorted chocolatey goodies. Pretty cool that I can do something like that in this city.\n\nPlayed some more guitar at the office and did some event planning for the hike. It seems I still get impatient when people don't respond when I ask them if they're interested in an event. Even though I don't need everyone to attend, I still want that to happen\n\n\n\nLinda finally responded on Facebook and we chatted a bit about life. Strange to be speaking french again. I asked her about the guy and it seems she's very infatuated. Perhaps it's real love, I don't really know. But it seems she's happy so that's good?\n\n\n\n\n", 1406606400=>"Our FYDP group met with Bernie to show our final result for the term. I thought we were about 50% done, but he thought we were 95% done. Hilarious. Bernie took some photos with the glove in silly poses. What a chill instructor. He advised that we move all the electronics off of the hand and just have wires go up into the hand. We have no idea how we didn't think of that.\n\nThe rest of the day worked on 457. Was a bit disappointed with Rox's lack of participation / her saying she would do her part / volunteering to help with the poster, then not doing it. Pretty much means can't trust her word when it comes to work. Michael bitched at me for how bad my algorithm performed and I got mega mad.

Why do I sometimes try to make them feel bad / isolate them to spend more time with me. Why have I been so concerned with stupid things like 'Facebook likes' and pop culture? There is so much more going on in this world. She didn't know what Harlem Shake was and it made me see how stupid all of it is. What's the point of showing off these things I'm doing?

It even had an all star cast.\n\nDinner at Spice 2. Decent szechuan food. Talked about how PM and consulting are both about communication skills and how they changed how Jon perceives / is perceived by people. How photography nowadays is different because we don't have to filter and can spam what we publicize. How the field of living room entertainment is still not a solved problem because things have evolved so fast recently with Netflix and everything. Non technical people still have a hard time setting things up.\n\nAte at a dessert place then headed back.\n\nTalked online with Ash a bit about life\n\n\n\nHope is a very powerful force.

Another awkward exchange with Hawaiians, don't know what's up with people there. I go up to the car rental counter and the guy is filling out a piece of paper. He looks up at me, then keeps on writing. While writing he looks up a couple times at me but doesn't say anything then goes back to writing. Once he finishes writing on that piece of paper, he picks up another one to do the same.

Poi is a peanut butter consistency made of taro.\n\n\n\nTonga we weaved a fish out of pineapple leaves. Someone later asked if those were fighter jets.

They lit a mat or something on fire, then would sit on it and get back up, the fire clearly still going strong. One guy threw a torched stick up a platform, another guy caught it and kept spinning it. At another point he was spinning a stick with one end lit, then decided to light the other end. To do so he lit his pant leg on fire then dipped the other end on that flame. Another time he performed a similar stunt with his finger being on fire. \n\n\n\nSpent the rest of the night planning the next day's happenings. I can't seem to just go a day just relaxing and not having a plan.\n\n\n\n\n"}
